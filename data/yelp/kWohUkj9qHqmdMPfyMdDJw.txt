First off, I will be back to this brunch spot - I was thrilled to see another South Loop alternative to Bongo Room and Orange (which I love, but am tired of the lines). The menu is huge, and is an ode to all things egg. My choice of corned beef hash and eggs was OK but not great. Also sampled some eggs benedict and a few of their skillet omelets... all very good.. . The restaurant itself was very spacious, with friendly service and a very short wait (even with a crowd). We got a table quickly at 11 on a Saturday, but the line looked a bit thicker by noon. Give it a shot...
