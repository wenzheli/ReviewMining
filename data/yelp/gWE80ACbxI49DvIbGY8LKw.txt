Restaurant: Glenn&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
This is an unusual review for me because normally I share my views regarding food, ambiance, and overall experience however today I'm sharing my option purely based on customer service. Yesterday my friends and I were having dinner when my friends purse was stolen. Although this is a rare occurrence at this type of establishment, it happened and the response and attention we received from the staff was impressive, they went above and beyond. First, several staff members ran down the street to find the potential culprits and also looked in garbage cans to see if the purse was thrown away, secondly, the manager called the employees of neighboring stores/bars to find out if they had seen the people who might have committed this crime, third and most importantly, they kept the restaurant open and stayed with us until we were able to figure things out. The manager stood outside with us while we waited for my friend to get a copy of her car keys and then when the manager had to leave, another staff member took her place and talked to us until we were ready to go (about an hour). Not until we were ready to leave, did the restaurant close. I'm soooo impressed with the service, that I will absolutely come back!  BTW, I had the Taiapia and it was delicious! My only complaint was that there wasn't enough.
