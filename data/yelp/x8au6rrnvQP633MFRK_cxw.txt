Restaurant: Sapori Trattoria
Category: Italian
Growing up with great Italian food everyday has made me an Italian food snob. So, I never expect good food at an Italian restaurant. I have always heard great things about Sapori so I thought I would check it out. I was pleasantly surprised!. . Everything we ordered was top notch. . I ordered the lobster Lobster Cappellaci and my buddy ordered the ossobuco. Both dishes were delicious. Even the wine the waiter suggested was great. . . I can't wait to get back here.
