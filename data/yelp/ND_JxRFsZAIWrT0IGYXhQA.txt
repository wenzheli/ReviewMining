Category: Diners
A bit of a goat rodeo, but the old school feel and the fast service makes it totally worth navigating the crowds. I've been here a couple of times; the food is good overall...but the pancakes are amazing. So many varieties, and the three buttery sides make every bite an adventure. . . When friends are in town, we hit Tom's for good food, good value, good service and great atmosphere
