Did the duck dinner, and it was great! We had a group of 4, and we ordered a few appetizers along with our duck dinner. Once you throw in the $3/bottle corkage fee, and three appetizers, it added up to about $75 for a table of 4, so not the uber cheap $30 bucks split 4 ways I expected, but still worth every penny. . . I will be back, soon!
