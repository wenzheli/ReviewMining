I purposely booked a trip to Chicago JUST for the deep dish pizza. I think i went into DDP food coma. This was the first (and best) place we stopped at. People will try to argue that Gino's East is better. It is not (it is good though) We just had the basic pepperoni and I loved everything about it. From the cheesiness, to the sauce on top, the crust....best part is, they deliver!
