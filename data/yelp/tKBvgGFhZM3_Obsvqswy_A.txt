I had my first experience with Thai food last night. It wasn't too bad, but I don't think it's my favorite cuisine.. . We ordered Pad Thai with Chicken, Ginger Chicken, Rice, Spring Rolls, Chicken Satay and some fried banana thing to have between all of us. The satay and banana were great, but I didn't reall like anything else. I don't know if it's just because I ordered the wrong thing, or because I don't like Thai.. . I agree with another reviewer that it was kind of odd to charge for rice, but it was only a buck, so no big deal. I probably will try Thai again, but I may visit another restaurant to do a taste comparison.
