I've been coming here since I was a student at UIC - i.e. much longer than I care to admit.  There are many choices in Greek town, and every Chicagoan seems to have their favorite.  For my money, Greek Islands simply has the best food.  . . My favorite option is to 'make your own combo'.  Can't decide on gyros or spanakopita? Choose both - they give you the option of getting two or more half orders (at just marginally more than half the full order price).  The kiddies can get a single half order.  The absolute best tsadziki in town.  . . For the uninitiated, be daring and get a bottle of Roditys - the traditional greek wine which is not white but not exactly red either and tastes a bit like Kool Aid at first, but by the time you get to the bottom of the bottle (at a whopping price of about 18 bucks) it tastes just fine.. . And the valet guys, most of whom have been here for 20+ years are lovely guys - they never ever fail to open my (passenger) door.  Tip well.  They deserve it and you are still out ahead since valet is free.
