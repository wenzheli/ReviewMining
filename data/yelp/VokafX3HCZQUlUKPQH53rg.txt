Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
YOU WANT FAST PHO???  Go to Tank Noodle.  . . With its prime corner location, the Tank is always busy.  I used to go to this place a few times a week.  The menu is extremely extensive, and I've tried other dishes, but I think the best stuff on their menu to which I always return is the Beef Pho (#47 on the menu.  It's simple and easy).  The beef, broth and rice noodles are bountifully served in a bowl bigger than your head.  Just shred some fresh basil, squeeze some lime in it, add jalapenos and you're in for a good time.. . The atmosphere is plain and simple.  No frills.  You sit, you are instantly handed menus as though you're at an American breakfast place, and as soon as you're ready someone will promptly take your order.  With the volume of Pho served here, you'll most likely have your bowl within 5 minutes.. . In addition to your favorite bubble teas, also on the drink menu is Cafe Du Monde Chickory coffee served with sweetened condensesd milk in it.  It's like drinking a cup of sweet sweet mud.
