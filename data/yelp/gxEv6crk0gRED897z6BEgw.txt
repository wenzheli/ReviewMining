We were looking for a place to eat close to the Century theatre, and based on Yelpers, decided to give this place a try.  . . We were not disappointed at all and Sapori lived up to its Yelp-hype.    . . We were lucky to be seated in the small middle room, which holds just 5 tables, making for a much more quiet, intimate dinner.  (Note to mgt: the walls could use some adornment, pictures/frescos/a splash of red sauce).  . . We started with the avocodo bruschetta.  My main avocado experience is only with guac, but this was a winner!  Creamy chunks of perfectly ripe avocado topped with thickly grated parmasan, diced provolone, and tomatoes on a toasted baguette.   It is a must-order!. . We shared entrees: rigatoni with freshly crushed tomatoes, basil, and mozzerella.  So simple and yet incredibly delicious and elegant.   The other shared dish were their ribs.  If you are expecting bbq or asian style, you will be disappointed, as these fall off the bone babies are more savory than sweet....something you'd expect to find in northern Italy.  Needless to say, not an ounce of meat was left on the plate.. . Tiramisu was excellent, though whoever dusted the top with cocoa powder overdid it quite a bit.  . . Service was excellent:  attentive and knowledgable.  . . Looking forward to returning and trying the lobster ravioli next time!
