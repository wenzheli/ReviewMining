Restaurant: Calo Ristorante
Category: Pizza
Calo is a five star restaurant with four star prices and a three star bar.  The food is fantastic.  From the ribs to the surf to the turf to the pizza.  I have never had any complaints regarding the food and neither have any of the friends I have taken there.. . Well, that is not entirely true.  The lady and I went there for an anniversary a few years back and I got the baby octopus.  She spent the enitre meal not being able to look down at the table and was quite put off when I had to dig a suction cup out of my teeth.. . The service can be a problem as I have on multiple occassions been subjected to a very inattentive waiter.. . Another problem with Calo is the bar.  The drinks, especially the wine list, are over-priced and avoid the place at all costs if there is a band playing.  I have never been there when a good band was playing and one of them bordered on terrifingly bad.
