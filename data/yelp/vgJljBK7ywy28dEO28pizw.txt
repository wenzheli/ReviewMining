I love Sun Wah, always have, but before last night I didn't know about the $28 Beijing Duck Special. . . Let me describe:. . They bring a whole duck and carve the breast and legs for you to eat with steamed buns, plum sauce, pickled radish, julienned celery and carrot.  The idea is that you will make little sandwiches, which are tasty, but you could also just shove the crispy duck into your mouth plain.  . . While you are stuffing your face, they take the duck carcass away and turn it into duck fried rice and tangy mild duck soup with winter melon. . . OMG, duck fried rice.  Most fried rice you get in Chicago is tasteless and sticky and gross.  This fried rice is flavorful, simple, and delicious.  . . Then at the end they bring you little bowls with mango and rasberry sorbet to cut through the greasiness of the duck. . . You will easily feed 4 people for your $28 (or two huge gluttons, with some leftovers to take home) - this is like Thanksgiving dinner good.
