i've been twice, and it was enough.  while both times i liked the food (the fajitas were quite good), the service was piss poor.  the first time, our waitress was very cold and seemingly hated working there.  on my return visit (because it is in my nature to give things a second chance), i would have sold my soul for a water refill.  i felt like moses wandering the desert... not good for an establishment serving several spicy and hot dishes.  furthermore, our waiter must have been the first waitress' male kindred spirit because he was not the friendliest of fellows.. . like i said though, the food was quite good.  good enough to get me back a second time.
