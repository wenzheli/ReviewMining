Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
I love this place, the food is so good, they have a nice selection of beers and it's a very comfortable place to grab a bite.. . The Pasta Bowl is a restaurant, but connected to it via a few doorways it the bar The Otherside. You can eat on either one, but if you want a low key meal and nice conversation stick to the Pasta Bowl side.. . I've never had something I didn't like and I've never brought anyone there who went away unhappy. Some of my favorites are Conchigle Gorgonzola, Clams Cappellini, Cappellini Pomodoro and the Macaroni al Fromaggi.. . They do dine in, carryout and delivery serve dinner pretty late. For a yummy meal that will curb your carb cravings go to the Pasta Bowl you won't regret it!
