This is a great little breakfast spot. Their menu is awesome and makes it really difficult to choose just one thing. I ended up getting their orange french toast and it was delicious. My friend ordered their pancake special and we were all a little surprised at how tiny the pancakes were - they were silver dollar-sized and there were only three of them - but other than that I enjoyed my meal here. I liked that the inside was very light and airy, although the lack of a designated area for people to sit/stand while waiting for their tables meant that there was somewhat of a crowd around our table while we were eating, which was slightly annoying. All in all I liked it and definitely want to come back to try their sandwiches.
