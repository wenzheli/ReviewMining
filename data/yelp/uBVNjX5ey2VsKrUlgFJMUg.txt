I think greek islands has the best food in greektown and i love the atmosphere.  The orange roughy is very tasty and worth fighting the loads of tourists clamboring to get through the doors.  The lamb is juicy and tender and i always love the potatoes.  I would skip the spanokopita as it is a bit greasy, but the rest of the food is very nice.  Don't miss the rice pudding.  I am obsessed with rice pudding and would probably eat it anywhere including off of the floor, but theirs is seriously  good.  I get a kick out of  it when people yell "oopah!" when setting cheese aflame as well.
