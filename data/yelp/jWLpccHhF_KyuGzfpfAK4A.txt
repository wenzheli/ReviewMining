what's not to love about 12 dollar sandwiches served with sneers from total bitches? also going there for brunch is the best because every time i want another glass of orange juice or a mimosa i get to get up and stand in line again, and they aren't usually very happy to see me buy more shit from them... i am also a huge fan of the twenty everpresent screaming babies they have installed to help bring kick my hangover up a notch. the chips are good.
