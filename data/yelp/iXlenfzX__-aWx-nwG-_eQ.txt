Basically, the best food and service my husband and I have ever had.  From the first course to the dessert tray they bring around (which is complimentary - so don't feel bad for trying everything) the food was delicious.  The flavors were out of the ordinary, but complimented each other perfectly. . . The service was second-to-none as well.  The wait staff was knowledgeable and extremely friendly.  The sommelier was spot on with his recommendation for both myself and my husband.. . If you are looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion (dinner will be an expense) this is well worth the dining investment.
