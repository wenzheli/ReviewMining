Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s
Category: Pizza
Giordano's is still my favorite deep dish pizza.  I've only been to this location once, and got take out since my hotel was just around the corner, so I can't comment on the wait staff.  I did have to wait in the takeout area for about 10 minutes.  Apparently my timing was good, since there were a group of guys in the bar that had more than 1 singing lesson, and broke out in song.  It even drew out some of the staff in the kitchen to listen.. . Getting back to the hotel, I got to enjoy what I consider to be the best deep dish pizza I've ever eatten.  Of couse like a dummy, I ordered a large for me and my wife, and we weren't able to eat the whole thing.  Good thing this pizza taste good the next morning cold for breakfast.. . If you get take out, don't forget to ask for plates and utensils.  You'll need them.
