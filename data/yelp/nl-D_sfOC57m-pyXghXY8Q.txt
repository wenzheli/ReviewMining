WOW  - My new favorite for brunch - no kidding!!. . I'm not sure why this place has been getting low stars, however my experience here was great! . . As the best-friend said: "No one should go a day longer without eating at Yolk!". . We're both vegetarian and not sure about non-veg, but their pancakes (Strawberry-Chocolate) and their Pecan French Toast were both amazing! Done to perfection, tastes amazing, cooked just right, a gastronomical treat!! The ambience was nice too!. . Only minus: service seemed spotty... but with this kinda food, who cares!!
