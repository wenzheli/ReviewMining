Restaurant: Sapori Trattoria
Category: Italian
One of my favorite restaurants in the city. The staff is great, the decor is fun (local art on the walls that you can purchase), and the food is outstanding. I have yet to order something that I didn't like and the wines here always make me wanting more. The only problem I've had with Sapori is that some days I've been asked to wait while there are plenty of empty tables.
