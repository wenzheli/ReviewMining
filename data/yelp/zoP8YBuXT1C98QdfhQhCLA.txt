this is one of the best places to eat in the city.. . the food is great, and its got a touch of class, without being stuffy.. . i was REALLY sad when they took away their thai calamari, but they still have the sunshine salad and a boat load of great, different, organic, fresh menu items.. . they also have great music there. i use to live around the corner from the uncommon ground in wrigely, and i would love just walking in and going straight to the music room, finding a spot and sipping a chai tea latte. aww... those where the good'ole days.. . this is really the perfect spot to take friends or family when they are in town. they will be impressed.
