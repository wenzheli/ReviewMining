Be prepared to wait, but I have nothing but praise for the deep dish pizza served here.  Their memorabilia collection is impressive, from Ron Santo autographs to a signed red Indiana sweater from Bobby Knight.  I assure you that the General does not eat just any pizza, much less part with one of his sweaters for one.
