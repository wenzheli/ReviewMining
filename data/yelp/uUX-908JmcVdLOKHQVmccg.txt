I LOVE Artopolis!. . I've only ever gotten things to go, so I can't speak about the dining experience there, but honestly the pastries are to die for. The tiramisu and the chocolate mousse cake are both awesome, and they also have good bread. . . I try not to go every week, but it's really quite hard to resist.
