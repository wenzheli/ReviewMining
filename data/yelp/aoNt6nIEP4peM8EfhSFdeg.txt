Category: Italian
This is way too expensive for eh Italian.  My nonna was born in Italy, so I eat more Italian food than I'd care to admit (and my butt shows it)...but I love it more than any other food.  . . The food isn't inedible, but it's not great.  Particularly for the price.  And the service.  On a pretty empty night I waited at the stand for at least 5 minutes, all the while making contact with 2 servers who were stopping to put down his/her glass of water or grab a rag, until someone asked if I'd been helped.  . . The food was not worth the wait.  Even the bread was stale.. . There is a reason this place is always on . http://Restaurant.com. , TwoBuckDuck, etc.  Because it's not a place to seek out.
