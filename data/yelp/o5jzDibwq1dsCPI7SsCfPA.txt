$110 will buy you two ZED Dinners. Mixed drinks average $12 a pop. This is how it works: . . The entire night you are served by different (student)chefs? who visit your table each serving something different. They will explain to you what you are eating and what preparation and care has been taken to whatever dish they serve you-- in my experience this is some sort of meat/polutry/fish dish all of which were delicious.. . Your meal will include two side dishes (ours was ratatoulli &amp; mash potatoes), cornbread, water and as many trips to the 'harvest table' as you'd like. Harvest table: food here is visually enticing but taste doesn't always match expectations. . . Chic trendy crowd, huge warm and romantic space, tasty drinks (though hardly strong), friendly and super attentive staff, very expensive.... overrated perhaps? You will most likely leave stuffed. I would love to give it a second chance but once might have been enough for me .....ouchy on the pocketbook.
