Yes...you MUST order the Crab Rangoon. They were different than the typical wonton style pillows of goodness I am used to,but....DAAAAAYUMMMM!! These babies are divine! They are little yummy purses of silky smooth,creamy and tasty delight. The dipping sauce has the perfect ratio of sweet and savory.Even if you do not have Thai for the rest of your meal. Get the Crab Rangoon!. . I love BYOB and stopped on the way from the L at a local liquor store and picked up a bottle of Prosecco. Always perfect with Thai or sushi. I had a lunch special sushi platter. Everything was fresh and service was very friendly and efficient. I would go back in a heart beat! . . The company was also top notch. Maybe, when I go back the weather will be cooperative and we can sit outdoors.
