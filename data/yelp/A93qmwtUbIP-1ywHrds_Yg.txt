Restaurant: Opart Thai House Restaurant
Category: Thai
I want to start by saying that I have always been relatively unimpressed by Thai food but Opart Thai is delicious.  The crab rangoons and the shrimp tempura are the best I have ever had.  I've tried them at other restaurants and nobody even comes close to being as good.  The service is good, the seating area is cozy, the food is pretty cheap and it's BYOB.  Their delivery is lightning fast too.  Overall, when it comes to Thai food, Opart really is as good as it gets.
