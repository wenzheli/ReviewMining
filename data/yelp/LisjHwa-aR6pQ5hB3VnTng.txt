Restaurant: Le Colonial
Category: Vietnamese
The food and atmosphere at this place are both great.  I had a date here last night, and it was the perfect setting.  That being said, I would not go to Le Colonial and expect your reservation to be on time.  Our reservation was set for 8pm , and we weren't seated until closer to 830.  The bar upstairs was a great place to spend those thirty minutes, but it did get a little crowded with all the other patrons waiting for their late reservations.  I'd go back, but only if I was in a mellow mood, unconcerned with the timeliness of dinner...
