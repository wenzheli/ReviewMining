First things, first - It's stupefyingly expensive.  Go on a company's dime (if you can) or save it for that really REALLY special occasion.  That said, the experience (as vouched by practically all who've dined there) is stupefyingly phenomenal.  It is likely that you will not swear the flavor of every single course is nirvana in tangible earthly form.  However, you will always say that the presentation, conception, and delivery of each course is art in its truest form.  . . And I guarantee that you will find - amongst the 12 or 24 courses - dishes that you swear is the work of a culinary prodigy.  . . One of those for the wifey and I was the Lobster of the Winter 08 menu.  The inspiration for that dish - as explained to us by one of the extremely capable waitstaff - was brilliant.   The flavors on the dish were complex but never clashing.  Achatz managed to incorporate multiple different elements that one would not normally use together - curry, lobster, and onion to name a few in this one dish - and bind them together flawlessly.  Truly, pure genius.  We also really enjoyed the caramel dessert - a perfect example instance where molecular gastronomy is merely the means and never the ends in Achatz's kitchen.  Another standout was the Wagyu beef/Miatake mushroom dish.  . . Service can best be described as impeccable.  . . Alinea is the gold standard for dining in Chicago.  Don't let the haters and illiterate dissuade you otherwise. . . I'm sure there will be a pang of regret come the time I open the credit card bill, but for those 3.5 hours we enjoyed our dinner in awe and without regret.
