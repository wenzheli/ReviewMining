This was our first deep dish experience.  I have to disagree with most of the reviewers.... I didn't like it as much as I thought I would.  There's too much cheese!  It'd be OK if it was decent cheese but it's too thick and the quality isn't there.  However, the price is right.  One medium pizza was about $25 and fed 4 of us.  I wouldn't go back to Giordano's..... there's gotta be a place with tastier, higher quality deep dish pizza!
