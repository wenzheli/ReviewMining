I like this place a lot.  I held a party here with some friends and they were able to accommodate us very well.  There were 10 of us and the only problem occurred when a friend who isn't good with "ethnic" food ordered a tuna dish and was surprised when it came raw.  I just laughed at her.. . The waitress was very attentive and asked what the problem was with her meal... I was proud of the waitress for not laughing at her like I did.  They were even kind enough to take that off the bill.. . The rest of us all loved what we ordered and agreed we'd definitely be back again.  The prices were also very reasonable.
