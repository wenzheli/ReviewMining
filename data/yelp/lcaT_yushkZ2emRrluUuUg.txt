Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
Pho wasn't bad but it was good either.....I got the pho with beef, tripe, meatballs...they sure were skimpy on the meat! I only got ONE meat ball!!!! The broth was really really plain....and I don't know if this is a Chicago thing but I don't know many Viet Pho restaurants that charge a gratuity for a party of 6 or more? That was very weird....However the employees there were really nice and they also made sure our water was filled up. But as for the Pho I had better!
