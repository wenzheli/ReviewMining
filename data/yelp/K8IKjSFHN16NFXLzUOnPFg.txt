Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s
Category: Pizza
Ok, so before I lived in Chicago, I had no idea this type of pizza existed.  (That's what happens when you grow up in the San Fernando Valley of LA)  But what a surprise I was in for when my co-workers introduced me to Giordano's.  Mmmmm...sauce...my favorite is the deep dish cheese and spinach stuffed pizza pie...yummmm.  For all those novices out there, the pizza is basically constructed with a layer of crust on the bottom, then cheese and whatever fillings you want and then another layer of crust with lots of sauce on top.  Now that I'm back in LA, what am I supposed to do now, dammit?!
