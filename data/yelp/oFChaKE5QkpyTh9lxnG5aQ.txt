Have you ever seen Kitchen Nightmares with Gordon Ramsey? Well, if you have, you know the death knell for any restaurant is when a chef sacrifices the taste of lovable, classic food to be 'different' or 'creative'. I wanted to love this place- with its awesome atmospheric book shelves and fireplaces and all- but have found the food strange at best. A chicken Caesar salad that has whole, GRILLED heads of romaine? I mean, think about it- what's less refreshing than a piping hot, charred hunk of lettuce with bits of ash floating in creamy, cheesy Caesar dressing? It was about as tasty and refreshing as a fart on a humid day- not what you want from a salad.. . From the sampling of what friends and I have ordered, I can safely say that somewhere in the back is a chef- or owner- that is trying way too hard. It's pub grub. Elevate it, sure, but don't mess up what makes it successful in the first place- a straightforward, simple approach to food that mimics home-cooked goodness in a comfortable atmosphere.. . I can only pray that take stock of what items are dropping off in popularity and cut them from the menu altogether, focusing instead on making great what's already good....and getting in the local crowd night after night.
