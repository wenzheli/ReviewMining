We ordered pizzza from here the other night and it was outstanding. It had a VERY thin crust and the sauce was perfect. We will order the zaa from here again!. . My family dined in the restauarant and they said the other food was good too. Yummy bread, huge pasta portions, and delish terramisu. Can't wait to try it.
