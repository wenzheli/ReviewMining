Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
I've passed this place maybe 50 times, the sign and outside always make it look like a dump. But a friend suggested it and wow am I glad I went. Its nothing special in terms of decor or ambiance, its pretty simple but maybe thats why youre not expecting much.  . . I got the gnocchi aurora which was just a celebration of flavors. Its absolutely divine with a load of cheesiness. We got the baked ravioli to start off which was also delicious. Altogether the meal was like 20 dollars for a huge amount of food.  . . I will definitely be coming back to this great restaurant, i can't afford not to.
