I went here with some college friends for brunch on a chilly Sunday morning. The bar was quaint and nice when we walked in, and we all had some mimosas to sooth our hang over and wait for a table. . . The food was very good, as I had a breakfast burrito with chorizo that was outstanding. A couple of my friends got the pork chops, which they swear by as the best. I will try those next time. . . Service was timely, and if they can deal with a group of 10 like they did with us, I'm sure you and your friends will enjoy your experience here as well.
