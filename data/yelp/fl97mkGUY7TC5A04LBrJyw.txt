Restaurant: Wilde Bar &amp; Restaurant
Category: Pubs
Like most really popular places in Chicago, Wilde is loud and crowded, and I would guess this is true of Wilde about 99% of the time. I prefer quieter places, but this is Chicago, and really good restaurants are typically not quiet ones. Wilde is definitely really good. Great ambiance and the food is great. My personal fav: the turkey burger.. . One thing though - if this place is going to be named after Oscar Wilde, they really should have the option of Guinness with Black Currant. I just know that Oscar wouldn't have his Guinness any other way.
