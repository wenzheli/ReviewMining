Restaurant: Alinea
Category: American (New)
Ok. Here we go.. . I went to Alinea last night for my birthday with my wife and two friends. Being the food crazed person I am, I have read much about this restaurant and have wanted to dine here since we went to MOTO last year. I'm breaking my opinion down into categories. . . What we ordered: Tasting (12 courses) and the wine paring. . . Atmosphere: Neat entrance (field of view / perspective is deceiving and very cool). Décor was ok (I was downstairs) - kind of plain /simple. There was nothing notable to me other than the amazing view of the kitchen when you walk in. . . Service: I thought the service was good- though I was a felt like they rushed through the descriptions of the food. I didn't hear about half of what I was eating or the story behind it. This is what we really liked about MOTO- the story behind the dishes was almost as interesting as eating it. The wine descriptions were much better. . . Food: Some hits, some misses. Overall, the food was good - but much more uninspired than MOTO. It felt like they were using a lot of the same themes (I counted 3 plays on hot and cold). There were two "wow" dishes- but I expected more in the 12 courses. I love the experimental food- but this just didn't live up to the hype. . . Presentation: Beautiful. Even as an industrial designer I was even a bit wowed by the use unique serving pieces. . . Wine: Absolutely incredible. This was the savior for me- the wine pairing and choices were amazing. Some of the best wines from unexpected places I have ever had. . . Overall: I would probably not go back. It was good, but for experimental cuisine in Chicago- MOTO reins supreme.
