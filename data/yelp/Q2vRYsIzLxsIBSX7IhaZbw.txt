Restaurant: Indie Cafe Thai &amp; Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I have been visiting Indie Cafe for 2 years now and I have never once been disappointed.  The sushi is by far some of the best in Chicago for both quality and presentation.  The entire restaurant has a young, hip vibe to it, and the wait staff is always very nice.. . This is an excellent date restaurant. BYOB and no corkage fee. Maki I recommend highly: Butter Ocean, the Dragon, Metallica, Las Vegas and the Volcano.
