I had heard really great things about Cafe 28's brunch, so a few friends and I decided to check it out recently on a Sunday afternoon.  When we arrived they were in a lul between lunch and dinner so we were provided tons of attention.  Myself and another girl decided to try their raspberry mojiotos and they were absolutely delicious!  I will definitely be back for another one of those if nothing else.  The brunch menu was very unique and we all had a hard time choosing.  Most everyone went with an egg dish, except for one decadent dessertish stuffed french toast.  We all had a taste of each others choices and the egg dishes were all very good, and the stuffed french toast was extremely rich and yummy.  It was a little too much for my taste, but if you are into sweet breakfast foods you would probably love it.  I plan to go back in the evening hours so I can try some of the entrees I saw on the menu, they looked fantastic.
