Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
My wife and I have been desiring some pho since she moved up to Green Bay, WI from Denver last June.  We have been trying hard to find a place to fill that need, even if we have to drive 2.5 hours to get it. I am not saying that this is the place for that, but it is a great start and there are a few restaurants down the street we will eventually try, but this is a good place to start.. . The pho tasted pretty good to me, though my wife found it to have too much cinnamon for her taste.
