I love the ambiance inside this spacious, English-styled, restaurant.  I've come here twice for brunch and had a great experience both times.  The brunch menu is pretty extensive offering a variety of British influenced dishes. I recommend the Benedict Wilde, Baked Brie and Eggs and the Buttermilk pancakes.  It also seems like a great place to grab drinks with friends or get a cappuccino and read a book. I frequent a lot of Brunch spots and this is one of the best places to go to if you have a large group.
