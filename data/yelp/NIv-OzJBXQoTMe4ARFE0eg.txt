I think this place is so neat.  Love the atmosphere and all the details... so rich and warm; I can't believe it used to be the hardware store.  They definitely did a great job with the interior.  Even the washrooms are neat.  The food is pretty good too.  You have to try the Beer Battered Cod... yum!  I also am a fan of the Chopped Salad (a bit different than the other places) with a great dressing.  It does leave your mouth dry and stinky though.  Staff is ok... could be better, but could definitely be worse.  . I'm not a big bar person, but I love hanging out here, just so warm... I'm glad I have a hang out close to home.  Welcome Wilde to the Neighborhood!
