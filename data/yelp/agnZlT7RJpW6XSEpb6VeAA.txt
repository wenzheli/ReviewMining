I shall give this restaurant 4 stars because the service, creativity, and presentation of the food is just superb.  Taste-wise, the food did not completely blow me away.  There were definitely some outstanding dishes but there were more "okay" dishes than I would have liked.  However, I really think it is more a matter of personal preference of the foods served.. . I have to give props to those who manage to do the Tour.  I had the Tasting, and I was pretty stuffed at course 10-11.  I was kind of hoping the food would stop coming.  The wine pairing is recommended if you can handle your drinks.  Ladies be careful.  That port at the end is STRONG, and they definitely give you more than what you'd get if you ordered port at other restaurants.  The sommelier is knowledgeable but if he were lying to us, we wouldn't have known the difference anyway.  None of us are that well-versed in wines nor are we very knowledgeable about the small towns in some European country of which the vineyards are located.. . The service is great.  If someone sees you leaving your chair, they rush over to help you out.  They lead you straight to the hallway to the restroom and open the door for you.  Your drink (if it's not wine) is constantly being refilled.  The waitstaff will even joke with you!. . As far as the food goes, it's a hit and miss.  My favorites, though, were the curry pork belly spring roll and the hot potato/cold potato.  I'm not even a fan of truffle, but my goodness, that dish was savory.  The creativity that goes into the dishes were amazing.  If you had not told me what I was eating, I would probably never figure it out except for maybe a few ingredients.  I love how they use scents to further the eating experience.  Overall, the meal was definitely an experience, and something to try once, but I don't think I would come here a second time.
