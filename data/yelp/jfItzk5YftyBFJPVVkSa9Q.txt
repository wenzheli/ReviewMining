Oh man, we really wanted to like this place but it just didn't happen. First off, it seemed really poorly organized -- we showed up at 7:30 on a Saturday without a reservation (obviously a busy time), and we were told it would be a 5-10 minute wait. So we sit down at the bar to order a drink, and the host immediately tells us a table is ready. So we pay up, but then another group comes in and he gives the table to him. We didn't end up having to wait long, but it was just poorly organized.. . The food. Was not great. I got the duck, which was quite good, but the jalapeno mashed potatoes it came with were lumpy and didn't really have any flavor besides spicy. And I'm not talking forgivably lumpy, I'm talking big old lumps that any mashed potato making novice could avoid with a modicum of care. My boyfriend got the roast pork, which was way too dry. It was pretty much an all-around bummer.. . The highlights -- the drinks were very good. The mojitos were excellent, really really excellent, and we also got a margarita that was similarly good. After the initial problems getting seated, the service was good, and I readily concede that we didn't have to wait more than a few minutes for a table on a Saturday night. . . Probably won't go back.
