Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Not only did I wait an hour to be seated, but I waited a half an hour at table before being served at all by a you-owe-me-a-living teenager who obviously didn't want to be there.  An hour after this I got my "stuffed pizza" which wasn't stuffed pizza at all.  It was just deep dish.  Maybe they brought me the wrong thing, but whatever they brought me, it was cold when it got there.  My girl and I finished one piece each, and about another half an hour later we flagged down our waitress.. Dialogue as follows:. Me:  Listen, this pizza is disgusting, and cold, and where have you been, we haven't seen you in an hour?!. Waitress:  You didn't like it?. Me: Are you kidding me?  Did you just hear what I said?  I want my check so I can just leave and never come back!. Waitress:  You want a box to take it home?. Me: Why would I take this home?  It's disgusting.  Get me my check.. It is the only time in my life that I ever stiffed a waitress.. HUGE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.
