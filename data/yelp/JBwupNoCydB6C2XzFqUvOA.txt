Considering that this place is barely a hole in the wall in kind of a run down area, the tacos and burritos are surprisingly good.  When you first walk in, the area looks kind of dirty, the staff is marginally helpful, but let me assure you, the food is delicious.. . So basically if you're looking for a little late night mexican dining, head to this place.  It'll do you right (until later that night.)
