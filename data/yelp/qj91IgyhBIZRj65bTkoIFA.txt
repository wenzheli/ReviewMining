a vegetarian walks into a churrascaria.... i know it isn't fair for me to review this restaurant but here goes anyways.... a work event brought me here.  i can't say anything about the meat entrees but the salad bar was pretty impressive.  it included a good variety of meats and cheeses.  the edamame salad, spicy long beans and pearled couscous salad were delicious.  the other prepared salads, however, were too overdressed.   i loved that some of the vegis - broccoli, squash, asparagus, etc. were served plain/lightly seasoned but accompanied by some interesting sauces or relishes on the side.  i also really appreciated the displays - all daintily placed on chilled platters vs. big chafing dishes.  it didn't make you feel like you were at sizzler!  the dessert platter was pretty amazing - bite-sized red velvet cake, spice cake, chocolate mousse, brownies/blondies and cheesecake.  . the bar area is very cozy with a psychedelic fireplace and huge TVs.  great wine selection and fun drinks (people rave about the blackberry mojitos and the martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives) as well.
