This is one of my favorite places.  The food is always fantastic - fresh ingredients, great cheeses and it's just like the pizza I had across Italy.  I am not a big fan of Italian desserts in general, but if you have room, they have some of the best desserts out there.  The tiramasu is wonderful.. . There is usually a longer wait, but who cares when you are with friends and are able to buy bottles of wine from the hostess?  Also the wait is made better when the owner comes around with samples of cheeses and his own pizza creations.  . . With fantastic food and a fantastic staff, you can't go wrong.
