I'm not sure which location this is but I went to the one which was near the museum of art. . . We did 2 medium pies for 5 adults - one was 1/2 plain and 1/2 spinach, then another was 1/2 veggie and 1/2 sausage. We also did 2 house salads. . . The salads were your normal pizzeria house salads but the pizza was interesting. It has a big old crust and sauce on the top layer, then the cheese is in the middle with all the stuffings (if you get any).  I don't really like crust to begin with I like my pizza super thin and I found it very filling and heavy.. . I just don't think I'm into that type of pizza but if you are then it is probably amazing.. . Also note that the deep dish stuffed pizzas take 35 minutes to cook!
