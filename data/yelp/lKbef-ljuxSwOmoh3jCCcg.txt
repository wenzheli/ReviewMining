Restaurant: Gino&#39;s East
Category: Pizza
I went to Chicago and ate at 3 different pizza restaurants within 4 days. Pizzeria Uno and Giordano's were excellent! Gino's East was number 3 of 3. Pizzeria Uno was the best! . . We ordered the supreme pizza with a patty-style sausage (per the recommendation of the server). The crust was excellent and the cheese was good. The bell peppers and onions were chopped too small. Regarding the "famous" sausage, we expected small breakfast-like patties. Wow, we were wrong! The patty was the size of the entire pizza! The patty sausage was terrible...all 5 of us disliked it! Avoid that and get the crumbled style sausage instead.. . Overall, I still liked the pizza and would go again. (Overall grade: B- with the patty style sausage. Without it, probably B+)
