Restaurant: Calo Ristorante
Category: Pizza
This is where my wife and I go when we want to kick back and relax. Actually, my wife took me here when I got a promotion at work after she had read some reviews on Yelp....and I know my fellow Yelpers will rarely point me in the wrong direction. . . We actually sat down and had dinner here, but sadly to say, have not had the pizza as of yet, which is a shame because that's exactly what everyone loves.. . You know what I love, the night that we were there, the manager, Sakhib, went around to each table and asked how the food was and how their service was, but not in that conscious bureaucratic way at some restaurants where you know its mostly for show. Sakhib seemed to be very genuine when he asked that question. And on top of that, once he came to us, the three of us really hit it off.. . You know what the best thing was, my wife and I came back about two months later, and I don't know how, but Sakhib still remembered us and remembered our names. How crazy is that??? I know...I know...that's their job, but seriously, to remember some random couple you only met once and remember their names and personal information about them is still an amazing feat and it made me feel quite special. . . The second time was just to drink and enjoy, and we relaxed at the bar with Don and met some of the locals. Basically, Calo's is a place where you can bring a gal for a romantic, or get together with your friends and treat it as the local watering hole.
