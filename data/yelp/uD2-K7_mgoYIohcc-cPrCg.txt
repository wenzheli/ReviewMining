Restaurant: Las Tablas Colombian Steakhouse
Category: Latin American
I've never had Colombian food before so I don't really have anything else to compare it to, but I'm probably hooked to come back to this place if I ever want a ridiculous meat-fest again. We got the Picada Colombiana, which is a little bit of everything (steak, beef ribs, chicken, pork sausage, plantains, yucca). Absolutely no need for an appetizer if you are getting this, I believe my belly was pretty destroyed and we had lots of leftovers. It seems other Yelpers are in agreement as well.. . I loved the chimichurri and the churasca sauces, but again was my first time having it. We later went home and made it ourselves, LOL. Good stuff. . . Our waiter was Carlos, and he will tell you everything is the "best of the best", which was hilarious. Very attentive dude, and I recommend him if you ever get a chance to go.
