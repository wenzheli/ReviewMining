Since I live in the area and after reading several reviews from Yelp on this place, I thought I would give it try.  In my opinion, it was "ok".   If you are a fan of traditional Chicago style or even thin crust pizza lover, you may be surprised by the product you receive.  Based on the cost (1 pizza for $16 that might feed 2 people if they order an app or salad), this place is not inexpensive.  I was not overly impressed by the flavor of this type of pizza, the top of the crust was crispy and flavorful but the bottom had a smokey-burnt flavor, probably browned from the oven.  I tried one of the Salsiccia e Broccolettii pies with sausage and rapini - which added a bitter taste to the sausage/mozz incredients.  An interesting change of pace but with so many great pizza places to try in Chicago, I would not seek this one out again.
