Restaurant: Las Tablas Colombian Steakhouse
Category: Latin American
Okay, first their food. Decent Colombian fare, with the meat dishes and seafood and all. We dont have much choice when it comes to Colombian food in Chicago, so this has to do. I'm Mexican, so Im used to eating with tortillas, which throws me off here. No tortillas to be found anywhere. They instead offer starchy stuff to be eaten with the dishes.. . The service is relatively bad here. Waiters never returning to see how your party is, and making poor accommodations for groups. We stoppped coming here for group gatherings because of the consistently bad service we got from these people. Not only that, they tended to try to rush us out of the place. Place gets too crowded on weekends, and if youre seated in the front room, you can count on people hovering above your table while they wait for theirs. They have enough business where they stopped caring about good customer service. Waiters tend to congegrate around the back area, talking as if they have no people to wait on.
