I've only been to the rooftop so far, but what an atmosphere.  My friends and I sat on banquettes that were surrounding a grassy lawn.  I've never seen that before.  Just glad it didn't rain earlier.  Get here early because they tend to have a line about an hour after opening.  The cocktails are on the expensive side and I wouldn't recommend ordering wine if you want your money's worth, even by city standards.  All in all, I would go back a few times a year for sure.  Can't wait to try dinner.
