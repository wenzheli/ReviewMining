WAY TOO MUCH FOOD- WAY TOO MUCH MONEY. . All you can eat meats served table side, salad bar, sushi, fruits = sick to stomach afterwards!  If you are a light eater, just skip this place it isn't worth it.. . Although everything was tasty, it was overwhelming - they are at your table every second asking if you want more and I could barely put the last slice of food in my mouth or finish a conversation.  Not good for a romantic anniversary dinner.  Plus the price is huge - $49 each.  Luckily we had a special coupon for buy one get one free, so we could splurge on a bottle of wine. :)
