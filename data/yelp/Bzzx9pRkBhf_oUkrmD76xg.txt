Well, I admit my sushi leanings are extremely tough to garner, but this place was pretty darn good (if a little pricey). Very cute spot on a neat stretch of street - friendly staff, and well-prepared sushi. The jalapeno miso doesnt do it for me bc i love the comfort-food aspect of miso. Tho I give them props for actually making it spicy - and I know my sister is excited to try it whenever she visits :)  . The Maki Mexicano is where it's at! I loved this roll! The lime isnt overpower, it just gives it enough unique flavor. And why don't more rolls use cilantro? Yum, guys!. . The Oedipus roll (name alone sold me) was just ok. The salmon roe on top was so divine I thought I would be falling in love here, but once you get past the toppings, the roll itself is rather dull.. . All in all a good, safe bet for satisfying sushi.
