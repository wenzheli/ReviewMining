I know a lot of people love this place, but I've been here twice for lunch and was really unimpressed both times.  To start off, the "salad bar" is extremely tacky.  The hot items, like the risotto and ravioli, are mushy.  There's nothing impressive at all about the rest of the selection.  I will say that the parmesan rolls they put out at the table are really, really good.  My main issue with this place was that the meat was kind of bland.  Most of it needed salt.  Also, the people bringing around the meat don't do a very good job of bringing around a variety.  I was with a large group both times, and they'd bring over a skewer of something (which would be enough for half of the table) and then never bring back another.  It got frustrating.  I'm not a big fan of the "all you can eat meat" concept to begin with, but when I do go to these kinds of places I at least expect delicious, well-seasoned meat and good service.  Neither of these things are to be found at Brazzaz.
