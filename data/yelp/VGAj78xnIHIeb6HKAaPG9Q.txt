Not bad.  Not bad at all!. . My friends and I grouped here on the Friday after CInco De Mayo to celebrate what I was calling Siete de Mayo.  I don't have high expectations from Mexican places in Chicago because it's just not as good as what you can get from the taco stands in LA.  However, this place definitely was one of my favorite mexican restaurants in the city.. . With it being a Friday, me and my 4 friends were in much need of a drink and their pitcher of margaritas didn't disappoint.  I usually don't order margs just because I typically like old man drinks that aren't sweet, but these were perfect.  Just the right amount of tequila and not too sweet.  The food was just as good, but my favorite part was their rice and beans.  They really can't be beat.
