Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
Tank has provided some great lunchtime experiences that I shall cherish.. . I was sick...Tank gave me Pho.  I was bored....Tank gave me great people watching.  I was hungry...Tank gave me delicious fresh spring rolls, perfect Bánh Mì or a wonderful Vermicelli Bowl (bun thit nuong).   . . My fondest memory was on a recent busy Sunday afternoon.  I dropped in solo, after being sick all week.  The food was hot, quick, delicious!  Ambiance  (if that's what you call it) was especially quirky and surreal...topped off by waitresses wearing Camouflage and HIP HOP bumpin' from the speakers.   Tank proved to be exactly what I needed for my soul that day.  Soup &amp; Snoop!  . . It ain't the prettiest girl at the dance, but Tank is a 'ride or die' type of spot...there when you need it...except on Wednesday's when they're closed :).
