What can I say, it is the heaviest pizza that you'll ever consume. You'll be hungry as hell when it arrives because it takes 30-60 minutes for them to cook the pie for you. So, maybe you should go here with 3-5 people and get yourself an appetizer. Normal people should be ok with an appetizer and a small pizza to split for three people. If you like the american giant meal, make that a medium pizza and you'll probably end up with left over crust.. . This is a hard place to eat if you are eating alone. If you do go alone expect to have at least an extra slice or two to take home with you to eat for breakfast or lunch the next day. . . Another shock for some people eating this type of pizza for the first time is the price, your smallest pie will run you 20+ bucks, that's normal, and lets face it with a pound of cheese on that pie...what do you expect?
