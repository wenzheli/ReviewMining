Restaurant: Tru
Category: American (New)
I enjoyed dinner at Tru last night.  I had the spring tasting menu and my husband had the grand tasting menu.  It was really lovely.  Each course had lovely freshly prepared ingredients.  The staff is very attentive and friendly.  It's a very approachable fine dining experience.  The desserts are always special here and there are so many of them!. . I was surprised to see foie gras on the menu, but now I understand that the ban isn't in effect yet.  It was nice and I enjoyed it all the more since it may be the last time I have it at a restaurant in Chicago.. . I like this restaurant better than Trotter's.  I think it's because the dining room is a more open space.  I always like to people watch a bit at these sorts of restaurants.  . . This is an expensive and decadent experience, but you only live once so treat yourself!
