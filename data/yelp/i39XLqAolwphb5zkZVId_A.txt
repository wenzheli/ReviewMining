Restaurant: Cafe 28
Category: Cuban
We were looking forward to eating at Cafe 28 for over a year and finally made it there early on a Saturday night.  Service was slow.  We enjoyed a couple of their cocktails -- pisco sour as good as it gets and the mojito was so-so.  The appetizers we got were much better than our entrees: we enjoyed papas rellenas (3 stars)  and halibut/shrimp ceviche (2 stars).  The disappointment came with the entrees -- perhaps if we had ordered off the Nuevo Estilo (new style) list it would have been more enticing but two standards were entirely uninspired: Ropa Vieja (flank steak) and Roast Cuban Pork -- the meat was edible but the sauces and sides left much to the imagination.  I was sad and would have spent my money and time elsewhere.
