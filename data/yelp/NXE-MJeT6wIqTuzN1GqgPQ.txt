Restaurant: Calo Ristorante
Category: Pizza
Calo's serves you the most delicious, soft, warm, delectable foccacia--as a free appetizer. 'Nough said. But there's more. . . I always tell myself I'm going to try something new, and even though my favorite dish is a bit pricey for me, I never fail to order the Linguine Al Frutai Di Mare. It's not a dinner plate--it's more like a trough--of the most delicious combination of pasta and seafood that you could ever imagine. I love seeing my server bring me a heaping bowl of clams and mussels, perfectly sauteed shrimp, calamari, and HUGE scallops. . . They serve so much food that I usually make three meals out of the leftovers. Particularly if I accidentally eat the entire basket of foccacia.
