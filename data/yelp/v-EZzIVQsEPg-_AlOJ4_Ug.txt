Restaurant: Cafe 28
Category: Cuban
Cafe 28 was a real "mixed-bag" experience. The restaurant itself is a great space, good atmosphere, has fantastic outdoor seating on the patio, and had very friendly staff (especially the bartender), for the most part. I say for the most part because a woman at the front of the house (who had the persona of 'the mother' of the family business), was surprisingly rude and off-putting. Despite that, it was an enjoyable experience overall. . . In terms of food, inconsistent definitely describes it well. The drinks were GREAT. I had a classic Mojito, which was fantastic and crisp, while my g/f  had a Sangria, which she was also very happy with and described as very "fresh-tasting". On to the actual meal: the "Taste of Cuba" appetizer sampler was fantastic, featuring the croquetas and empanadas. However, the Ropa Vieja (which I'd read rave reviews about) was quite disappointing and dull. Also, the Tamal Cubano, which is composed of ingredients that I love independently was poorly executed as a dish and was overwhelmed by an unpleasant after-taste. . . In review, go for the drinks, chats with the barkeep, and the "Taste of Cuba", but move-on to greener pastures for dinner.
