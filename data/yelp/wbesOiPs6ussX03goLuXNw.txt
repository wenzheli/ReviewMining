Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
This is the place to go for hot bowl of aromatic pho despite the poor service. The broth is rich and tasty (a bit heavier than pho 777). I usually order the house special sans the brisket. The beef is not as tender as I would like but it's still pretty good. The tendon melts in your mouth and the tripe is just the right texture. If you prefer chicken, the chicken pho here is excellent and by far the best in the city. The menu is huge, and I have to say I have not tried much else there. The spring rolls and Vietnamese crepe were just as good as you would find elsewhere on Argyle. The shrimp eggrolls were a disappointment, however. The iced coffee was pre-mixed and a bit too sweet. If I am craving pho, Tank is my number one destination.
