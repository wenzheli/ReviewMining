I just checked this place out last night.  It was pretty good. I had the Greek crepe with chicken added.  The quality of the filling ingredients was excellent.. . My initial thought was that the crepes were a bit overcooked.  The service was pretty good, and the Turkish coffee was alright.. . I left having spent $19 bucks on dinner and was still hungry, though.  Seems unusual, as crepes usually sit on my stomach like a ton of bricks.. . All and all, I'd try this place again, but my first adventure there was a little mediocre.. . Three Stars
