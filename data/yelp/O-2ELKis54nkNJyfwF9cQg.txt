Same girl, same guy, same fireside table in the 'library'-- do whatever it takes to get this table-- stalk, pout, scream-- it's worth it.. . I had the mac n' cheese this time around. It's everything Colleen C mentions in her review plus you've got to factor in my own adoration. Get it, you won't be disappointed.. . Wilde's has also added a few more 'wintery' beers to their bottle roster-- think vanilla porters and chocolate stouts. I had the Poet, not only aptly-named to be served in this bar but also rich, chocolatey and smooth. . . My only gripe is that Wilde's is selling their beer at a higher price point than similar establishments and the food is also expensive. But, judge me by my actions and not my words because... I keep going back for more.
