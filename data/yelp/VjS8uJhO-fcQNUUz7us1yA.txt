I've been here a couple of times now and always with a good size group of friends or family. It is a good place to get together, chat and discuss the different meats we get to sample. . The decor is nice and the ceilings are tall. The waiters wear costumes but they are in no way ridiculous. You have a lot of choices (meats and the food bar) and will most likely overeat so this is definitely a place that you can't visit too often. . Fried bananas and the little puffy bread are awesome. It has been a great experience everytime I've been.
