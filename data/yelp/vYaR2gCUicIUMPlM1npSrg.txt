Restaurant: Indie Cafe Thai &amp; Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
Immediately after stepping out from the Thorndale red line station, your olfactory organs are filled with something amazing. If you continue walking west on Thorndale and then north on Broadway, you can follow that smell straight to the doors of Indie Cafe. One day after work, i had enough--I walked the extra block to my house, grabbed my fiancé and came right back for dinner.. . Because its a Thai restaurant, I am hesitant to try their Japanese dishes. However, their spicy basil fried rice is my favorite dish. Not only is it tasty, but it will clear your sinuses. The fiancé is a fan of the tempura sushi which he orders every time.. . After every meal, be sure to order their mochi ice cream in mango or strawberry.. . They can get crazy busy during dinner time on the weekends so be sure to call ahead and make a reservation.
