Restaurant: Gino&#39;s East
Category: Pizza
Special props to this specific Gino's.  It is my favorite of all the Gino's locations I've been to, &amp; I've hit them all.  I went here with a co-worker today on our lunch break to go over some Invoices and account opportunities.  Bad idea going here during the week on a lunch break because you will leave so stuffed,  it will hard to be productive the rest of the day.  Also, this is the best location to have a true business lunch because you're going to order the Deep Dish, and it's a 50 minute wait. You have no excuse not to get anything done!. . Because there are so many hotels in the area, this restaurant is a MUST to experience true Chicago pizza for you in-town visitors.  Of course us locals will all have our favorites, but this is always in the debate and this location is conveniently stationed right off of Michigan Ave so there is no excuse not to go.. . LOVE the staff here. Cordial, upbeat, prompt, they wait on you hand and foot EVERY TIME.  Without question this is a 5 star food with a 5 star atmosphere.  Tourists, you don't have this in your hometown, so make it a point to get here.  A recent Sunday Night football even featured this specific location during the Bears Eagles game, and rightfully so. If the multibillion dollar NFL is pimping it, you need to get on this place.. . As I said for another location, if you're seeking the best of the best Deep Dish in Chicago, end of search, you're looking at it! . . Locals, next time you have to bring your ipod into the Apple Store because the hard drive crashed (again), go around the corner over here to Gino's East.  I know we want to get out of tourists' way as soon as we possibly can anytime we get stuck down here, but this is worth sticking around for. Dig in.....
