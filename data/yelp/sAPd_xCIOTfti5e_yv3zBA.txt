Restaurant: Alinea
Category: American (New)
A million things have been said about the wonders and delights that rest behind the star trek entrance that is the front door of Alinea.  This place is not for the faint of heart or the frugal diner.  To put it mildly, this one meal is going to set you back a month of rent, and we are not talking about the rent for a studio in Pilsen.  More like a two bedroom in Lincoln Park or the Gold Coast.. . Yet, despite the high cost, it is an amazing journey that any self proclaimed foodie should experience at least once in their life.  Grant Achatz and his team of scientists and wizards design dish after dish of wonder. This meal is a sensory blitzkrieg.  After every dish, I could not imagine how they could outdo themselves with the next only to be even more surprised with the next mixture of flavors and smells that assaulted my palette.. . Alinea is not for those who don't appreciate a good meal.  This is art in its highest form and takes a true connoisseur to appreciate the subtleties in each dish.  If you decide to go, I recommend that you take the 24 course tour with the wine pairing.  You should take the opportunity to try all of the creations and flavors that they have prepared, but it is a ton of food so come hungry.. . Alinea is a once in a lifetime experience....... savor it and enjoy!
