Once upon a time I would have rated Glenn's at 4 stars. I've been going there for about three years now, mostly for breakfast. I've always enjoyed my meal there.  I've been staying away lately due to large crowds and a rude host. This guy always has an attitude and acts offended/flustered if you ask for a more spscific wait time. Sorry, but "it will be a while" is not sufficient. Do you mean 10 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour? Ask this guy and he goes into a huff. EVERY TIME he is working he is in a tailspin and shifting tables and chairs practiaclly on top of you and drops the menus in front of customers in a rude manner. I loved breakfast at Glenn's but the host makes me lose my appetite.
