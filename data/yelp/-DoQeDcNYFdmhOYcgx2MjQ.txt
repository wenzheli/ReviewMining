I went to Uncommon Ground for brunch on a Sunday after deciding NOT to endure the 45min wait for M Henry. I was NOT AT ALL disappointed.. . There was no wait. The waitress was excellent and friendly. The food was amazing. My dining companion had the best graham cracker latte thing in the world. I had pecan crusted brioche french toast, which was just the right amount of sweet and wonderful. I, of course, also ordered side potatoes &amp; bacon which were both great as well.. . On my second visit I had a skillet of cheese grits with pulled pork that was absolutely to die for. I accompanied it with a Black Eyed Dog which was lovely. (Vodka with blackberry/cardamom syrup). . . I can't wait to come back...I loved brunch but I really want to come for dinner, especially since their beer menu is so good!
