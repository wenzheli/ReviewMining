No you aren't at IKEA. You are at Yolk, despite what the blue and yellow surroundings are telling you. . . I wasn't really a fan of the food here - of course I probably should've ordered the namesake and got an omelette or a couple eggs. Instead I got French Toast which was your run of the mill french toast. I didn't like the sausage at all - it had an off taste. The eggs were good though :). . My dad got 2 fried eggs with all the extras (potatoes, toast, bacon) and thought it was great. I'll have to go back and stick with eggs this time and see how it goes.
