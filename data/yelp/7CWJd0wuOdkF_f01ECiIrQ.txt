Restaurant: Calo Ristorante
Category: Pizza
I love Calo's. At first I made the mistake of thinking it was just one of those mediocre, old-school Italian places. Wrong! While it had some old-school Italian charm (the older Italian waiters, live music in the bar certain nights) it has a lovely, simple decor and the food is fantastic. This is the perfect place to go on a date, take out of towners, and just hang out with your friends or family. I've heard the pizza is delicious, but I'm so addicted to the ribs (go Monday, rib special!) and the penne al vodka, that I can't stop ordering them each time I'm here. I swear I will venture outside my comfort zone and order something else NEXT time! Anyhoo, the price is good...not too expensive and you will have leftovers. Love it. It's my consistently good go-to place!
