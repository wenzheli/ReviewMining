Went here on a Tuesday for lunch.  It wasn't too crowded but there were plenty of people eating there.  I loved the decor and feel of the place - everyone was so nice.  Got a bistec (with cheese) and lechon sandwich to go along with a mango shake.  Everything was so delicious! My bf and I will definitely be coming back - the breakfast and dinner looks great.
