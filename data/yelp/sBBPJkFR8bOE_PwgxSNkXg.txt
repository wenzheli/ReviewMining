Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
If I had one of these where i live, I think I would be sixty pounds heavier... I had the ravioli with alfredo... you think, "basic," I guess I wasn't expecting something as good as it was. I never knew alfredo sauce could have sooo much flavor! I guess I'm just from a small town that has NO good italian restaurants (Olive Garden doesn't cut it...) When we went, Monday afternoon around 2, it was rather slow, but everything was extremely quick... I love how I got to watch the food being made from the table that we sat at...
