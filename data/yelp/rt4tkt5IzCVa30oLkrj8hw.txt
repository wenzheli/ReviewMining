Restaurant: Tia Pol
Category: Tapas Bars
This place looks unassuming from the outside, but it's always crowded for a reason. The chorizo with dark chocolate is worth the wait alone. The fried chick peas the the lamb skewers are also really good. The space is dark and on the small side, but the staff is friendly and helpful. Note, the bar is for eating, not just to grab a drink. On my last visit, a gentleman at the bar seemed to have difficult time understanding this. Tia Pol is one of my neighborhood favorites.
