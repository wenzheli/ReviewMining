Opart Thai has, by far, the best beef salad I have ever eaten.  It was perfect.  The spiciness and the beef to vegetable ratio were perfect.  I loved it!!  I found myself taking sips of the leftover sauce.  I've tasted my friend's chicken panang curry and that was delicious as well.  I will definitely come back here again for their beef salad and also try something else!  Service was great as well!
