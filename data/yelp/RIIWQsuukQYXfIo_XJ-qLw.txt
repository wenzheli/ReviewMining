Decent Italian food in an ever-increasingly expensive area.  I have been here a few times and also family, who has lived in andersonville for 25 years, likes this place, so I cannot argue with its authenticity!  the owners/bartenders/waiters are Italian which is always fun.  the food is pretty good, the atmosphere okay.  i will continue to go, but not my favorite place esp. since i am not a local, and there are so many other andersonville places to try!
