I think I'll have to come back here for breakfast because I wasn't that impressed. Maybe it was because I was totally exhausted when I came in with a group of friends after a fun weekend but it didn't wow me. . . I had the Grilled Chicken with Bacon, Lettuce, Roasted Plum Tomatoes and Bleu Cheese Spread on Ciabatta. It was alright, I thought the chicken was kind of dry. My friend always gets on my case when I order a chicken sandwich at a place I've never been too, but it's what I wanted. . . I did order the Pesto with Pine Nuts though as a side and that was pretty awesome. The lemonade I had was really tart and I loved every minute of it. My friends had the Smoked Turkey Reuben with Sauerkraut, Swiss and Dressing on Rye, it was alright, but nothing to rave about. The food kind of reminded me of Corner Bakery. . . They also had some really good looking deserts, cookies, cupcakes and such so I will have to try those the next time I'm in.. . I've come to the conclusion, that the main draw of this place is the breakfast because the lines are down the block on the weekends. . . It's really cute on the inside though, but there's not a lot of space to sit which is a downfall but the fireplace is a nice touch. I will say, the girl at the counter wasn't too friendly, but maybe she was just having a bad day. . . My opinion, breakfast may work better than the lunch menu.
