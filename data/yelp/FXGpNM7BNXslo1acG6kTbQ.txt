Restaurant: La Pasadita
Category: Mexican
i will admit an back-in-the-day, i disagreed with someone about who had the best steak for tacos/burritos. my stance wasn't la pasadita, but i did become a convert and i accept my mistake.. . in the 90's i had 5 stars on this bad boi easy. but now i am stripping 1 star for foolishness and out of being stubborn. you want a restaurant to stay golden forever, in your sweetest of memories, in your love for the beef of the heartland, in your love for steak again and again. the pico de gallo remains ON-POINT but all the salsas could use the old-school. heat they used to brandish. la pasadita, my wreckless youth missed you and you were good, but not astounding as recall you to be.. . expect mix mashed experiences by the servers and service over all. realize: they are well-intended and short staffed. the space is sparce so think hella casual with a recipe of cops, hipsters, late night drinkers, youth, people of color, and your occasional secretly curious vegan. for $8 for a horchata, a burrito or two tostadas, endless chips &amp; salsa, you still have a fine buy and a fine chicagoan mexican meal.
