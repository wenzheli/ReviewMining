My first time trying sweet potato fries and they were delish.  The meatloaf with a side of spinach and mash potatoes was good but the gravy way too salty.  It was inedible!  Also the calamari has was drenched in a sweet and sour sauce, which was too rich and soggy. 3 stars for their concept, warm atmosphere and sweet waitress.  My friend had a drink (that i still daydream about) which consisted of eggnog and apricot.  I don't remember what it was called but it was exquisite.   Make sure you have enough money because it's pricey.  I highly recommend making reservations on the weekends.  We went on a Friday night and it was packed.
