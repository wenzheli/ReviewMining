Best Pizza in the world. Better than Lou Malnatis or Gino's East! The deep dish is the best. No one comes to Giordanos and gets a thin crust!!! The sauce is perfect (YES IT IS ON TOP IF THE CHEESE), the cheese gooey, and the double crust is heaven. Perfectly spiced.One slice fills me up of pepperoni and cheese. The service is never bad in my experience and I like the atmosphere, very Italian. They have a lunch special too which I always get , you get a salad or soup, your own indvidual stuffed pizza, and a can of pop for like $7 bucks. The sandwiches and appetizers are also delicious, my mom always gets the chicken.  But....get the pizza you won't be sorry trust me!! Greasey flat New York Pizza does not come close...AT ALL!
