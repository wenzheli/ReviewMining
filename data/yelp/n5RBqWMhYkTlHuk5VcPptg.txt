I had a great time at Cafe 28!  To begin with, the raspberry mojito is delightful (although a little pricey at $9).  The atmosphere and service were great, and having gone pescetarian for the evening, my almond crusted halibut with saffron cream and jalepeno mashed potatoes was excellent.  Definitely enjoyed myself here, but will probably reserve it for special occasions from now on.
