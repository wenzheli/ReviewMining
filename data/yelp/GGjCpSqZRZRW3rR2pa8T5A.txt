The best pizza I have ever had, period.. . Worth the wait, worth the money.  These folks are serious about pizza.. . We've been multiple times and have never had any variations in quality.  Each visit has proven consistent.  I have serious respect for a place that won't open if the dough doesn't turn out right that day.  They'd rather lose money by staying closed than to produce an inferior product.. . Oh, I nearly forgot -- don't bother going here if you're looking for pepperoni.  You won't find it on the menu.
