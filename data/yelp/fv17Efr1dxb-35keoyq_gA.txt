Attractive dining room, eclectic bar, attentive service.  We tried the chef's sampler of 4 random maki rolls ($22) - good deal and yummy choices.  In addition LOVED the Kani Chung roll (had to get it b/c of the name alone)!  OK wine selection but it is BYOB so the potential is there.  Felt a little rushed by the server (it was prime time on a Saturday night)...  but should you rush out the 2 girls drinking wine and tasting sushi - now there's potential!!!
