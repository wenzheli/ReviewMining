Restaurant: Wilde Bar &amp; Restaurant
Category: Pubs
"Love &amp; gluttony justifies everything." . --Oscar Wilde, Dorian Gray . . I just love Oscar Wilde's wit and humor, so to be able to come in here and dine like a poet in this very literary pub, was this writer's dream come true. . . Upon walking in on a brisk Friday night, I felt right at home. They had this huge wooden bar where we sat drinking Stella's for about twenty minutes before our table was ready. . . Our server, Jessica was very friendly and asked if we had any questions about the menu, we didn't. Then it was time to order and I decided upon the Rueben Gone Wilde! I just loved saying this name, it made me smile and the sandwich itself was terrific too! Molasses glazed Chicago corned beef piled high on pumpernickel with melted Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Marie Rose sauce. So delicious that it totally hit the spot. . . Next time, I will have a side order of their famous mac and cheese and have to be rolled out of the bar, since I will be so stuffed.
