I came here before the renovation with my friend who has lived in the area for.. ever. haha He swore this was the best place on Argyle. I was kinda grossed out by the interior.. . BUT THEN, I recently came back here with two girl friends post-renovation. Oh la la, what a change! The lofted ceilings, clean floor and furniture make the experience so much better. We had the roasted duck, the seafood combination over rice and a soy chicken dish? And ofcourse, a couple tsing taos :). . The food was great, and the interior so much better but best of all was the attentive service staff. So many different waiter/waitresses stopped in to welcome us, make suggestions and ask how we were enjoying our meal. All in all, this was a great time with great food... and it doesn't hurt that the meal was so cheap!
