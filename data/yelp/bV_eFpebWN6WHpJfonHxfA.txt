In one word - phenomenal. One of my new favorite places to eat in the city.  From the decor to the service to the food and wine, everything was great.  I went to Vietnam last year and I've eaten at Hai Yen and many of the places on Argyle Street; if you want authentic Vietnamese food, those are the places to go.  Go to Le Colonial if you want terrific Vietnamese insipired food and an amazing dining experience.
