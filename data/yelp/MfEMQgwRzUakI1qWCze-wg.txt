This place is just gorgeous! The decor details were absolutely classy and really reminded me of the scenes in "The Quiet American:" ceiling fans, banana trees, antique oil lamps, etc. We sat at a table on the balcony upstairs and enjoyed watching the busy street and elegant people socializing below. The food was excellent. I wanted to have all of their appetizers as I hadn't had them for a while but we only got Betel Leaf wrapped beef and lotus root salad. The Vietnamese-styled beef steak I had tasted like homemade. Overall, excellent food, great service, and unique atmosphere. I'll come back for more to cure my craving for mom's food!
