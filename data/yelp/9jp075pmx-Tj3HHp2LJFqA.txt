This place was fantastic. I found it in a local paper when I was there this weekend. I wasnt really sure what to expect but it was close enough to go to the Field Museum and all of those sites near there! I had the Tuscan Frittata (Chicken, Sundried Tomatoes, Onions, and Basil) with Egg Whites and a side of pancakes. It was around $9 and I was left full.  My friend had the Meat and Eggs Combo for around $8.50 which included 2 eggs, 2pcs of meat, and 2 pancakes (or toast or english muffin). She really liked it as well!. . We got there just before 9:00am, about 20 people waiting, and we only had a 15 minutes wait! It was well worth it because the food was fantastic. The ambience was entertaining and it left me full for the entire day. . . I noticed that when we left around 10:00am, there were about 50 people waiting outside to get in... so I suggest going early, getting a to go menu to look at so you know what you want to order when you get there, and don't be in a rush... it was worth the wait!
