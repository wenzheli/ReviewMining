As a New Yorker making my first trip to Chicago I was pumped to try some Chicago deep dish.  When we got in we were staaaarving and this place was around the corner from our hotel and had also been recomended by others before our trip, so off we went... it was Chicago Pizza time!!! . . We ordered up a plain cheese pie and the pepperoni, pepper and onions pie (there were 5 of us hungry NYers). I thought it was all pretty good, the sauce was well spiced but I do have to say I was not blown away. . . It was a fun place for a group lunch but nothing that memorable. I was hoping to be awed.
