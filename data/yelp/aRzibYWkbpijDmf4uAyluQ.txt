This is going to sound really weird but I swear our waitress here was the girl from the last James Bond movie, Eva Green.  She looked and talked exactly like her.  At the time, I knew she reminded me of someone famous but I couldn't recall who.  It just struck me now.. . So, Eva Green, if that really is you working at Ikosium (in preparation for a movie role, I presume) I'm sorry I blew your cover.  You were an excellent waitress if it makes you feel any better.
