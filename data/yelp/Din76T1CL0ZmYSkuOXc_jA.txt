1 star for the coulette. 1 star for the black pepper filet.. . That's about it, out of 15-20 meat offerings. All the other cuts were simply ok or not good at all. . . Everything in the salad bar was just ok as well, and the price (50-60 a person)  is most definitely not worth it for a place that is, again, just ok.. . If trying different cuts of mediocre meat in an attempt to broaden your carnivorous horizons is your thing, then Brazzaz might be for you.. . If you want something, anything, better than mediocre, go elsewhere.
