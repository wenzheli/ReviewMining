After reading the recent Metromix article about the best 16 places to get wings, we decided to try this place out.. . We went at 7pm on a Friday night and got seating right away for 3 of us.  For an app, we got a plate of 16 wings to share - half spicy garlic and the other half were sweet bbq.  OMG we couldn't believe HOW GOOD the wings were plus they were HUGE.  They looked more like drumsticks than wings.  We were impressed and glad we checked them out.. . As for meals, the 2 guys got the steak sandwich on garlic bread with waffle fries and the sandwiches were HUGE.  They said the fries were perfectly done, too.  Not overly fried or undercooked.  . . I ordered a salad that had goat cheese, pinenuts and topped with chicken and it was delish!  . . We all shared a cookie bowl for dessert and the cookie was still hot in the center and melted the side of ice cream perfectly.. . We all agreed that we'll definitely go back and have the wings as a meal next time.  We had plenty of leftovers, too.. . Oh as a soon-to-be-Mom I noticed 3 or 4 kids at various tables that were quietly eating their meals and coloring.  It's nice to see a kid-friendly place on a busy Friday night!
