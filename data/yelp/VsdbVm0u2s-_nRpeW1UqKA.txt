One of my favorite italian places. The lobster butternut squash ravioli is so unique and wonderful. I recommend you get a reservation since it gets crowded quick on the weekends. Also, request a seat in the back room so you don't feel so cramped. Service is also excellent. Every waiter or waitress I have had has been beyond attentive.
