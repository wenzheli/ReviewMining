Category: Sushi Bars
I've been going to Wakamono once a month for over a year--best. sushi. EVER. I've had sushi all over the east coast and all over Chicago, and I keep coming back here. The service is PERFECT and the chefs are amazing. This place also played a strong role in my boyfriend's proposal to me...they served us a GORGEOUS meal, complete with flowers and hearts made of strawberries and grapes AND a complimentary dessert. I will always choose this place for my sushi fix.
