OK so friends and I used to be great fans of Wilde for brunch.  They had some of the top pancakes in the city as well as my personal favorite corned beef hash, slightly spicy, made from real shredded corned beef.  Service used to be friendly and quick as well.. . Now, the past several times I have been, the corned beef has been replaced by pre-processed mush, and you can taste the can it came from.  Pancakes not as good either, especially as they have arrived cold lately.. . Finally, the last time I was there, the waitress spilled an entire glass of water all over my dining partner and our table.  Ok, maybe just a mistake, but then half an hour later we returned when my friend's Blackberry, which also got doused, had ceased to function.  We asked to speak with a manager, who told us she was too busy to speak with us because there were lots of people in the restaurant, and she didn't see how this was her problem.  We asked if there was anything she could do, and she responded that my friend didn't look that wet and she can't just give handouts to everyone who asked. In her place I might have comped our meal or at least given us a free drink for next time.  She made it clear she couldn't care less about us.. . I was thinking about cutting this place from the brunch rotation anyway, and after this I know I won't be back.
