Category: Pizza
Giordano's.  Pizza.  Stuffed.  Me.  Stuffed.  Pure satisfaction.. . So, I went here on a convention once and boy was I pleased.  You cannot get stuffed pizza this good anywhere on the west coast.  So we're all kind of buzzed from the nice cool pitcher(s) of beer that we managed to polish off while they were baking our 14" large stuffed pie, and we have some friends from Southern California there, and they are absolutely starving, and we sort of forgot to tell them that they give you forks and knives for a reason.  Hot pizza sauce, short pants, good times.
