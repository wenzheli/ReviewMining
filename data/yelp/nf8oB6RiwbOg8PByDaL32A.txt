GAROSS.. I just ordered steemed beef tacos and while the meat was OK tasting I didn't eat the third one because midway through the second I bit into a giant piece of fat... and I hate the consistany of fat from meat. . Plus, 3 tacos for 10$ is rather pricey, actually. . I mean, theres not much to say other than that, I'll never be back... honestly, I'd do Taco Bell first.
