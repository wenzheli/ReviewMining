I have been to Tru twice.  The first time was the night I put the ring on my wife's finger, the second time was to celebrate a new job.. . Tru is a choreographed experience from the beginning to the end.   Everything is seamless as they take your coat, escort you to your table,  to your fabulous dinner.  My wife and I loved every piece of it, and it is a three hour experience (don't plan on dinner and a show).. . Tru is expensive, but it is very very special.  Do not expect to see Gale Gand (from Sweet Dreams) or Rick (famous Chef) on-site . .  but that doesn't hurt the food.  Both times my wife and I went to Tru we ordered a three course menu and added an optional course (1st time Cheese, 2nd time upgraded the dessert to a 3 course chocolate tasting).  Though the courses themselves are balanced (not cheesecake factory huge), we did not go away hungry. . .and I'm a big guy :). . Nice Touches: Setting the plate for all members of  your party simultaneously, the coffee cake for the next days breakfast, an amazing bathroom (if not that functional).   . . Tru will always have a special place in our hearts.  My wife and I love great restaurants and Tru beat Paris' Tour D'Argent hands down (ripoff),  and is a little bit more of an experience than Gary Danko's in San Fran.  Now that I live in Chicago I look forward to trying Aliena and Charlie Trotters
