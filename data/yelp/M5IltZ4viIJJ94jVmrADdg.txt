No no NO. We come to Chicago for the city, the architecture, the lake, the FOOD. And we go to places like this, HIGHLY recommended to us by others, others in whom we blindly have faith. No no no. A disappointment this was. And REALLY it was. I don't like soggy crust. I don't like preserved alfredo sauce that turns to goop after 2 minutes on the table. I don't like waiting ONE AND A HALF hours to be served an OK pizza. NO.
