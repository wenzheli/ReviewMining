Restaurant: Tru
Category: American (New)
We went with the same friends who later accompanied us to Alinea.  Tru does not justify itself by comparison.  . . Tru's he service was WAY too self-conscious, the food was good(not amazing), and the bill was titanic.  Also despite the place being half-full when we arrived, we got the table right in front of the kitchen doors, which ruined it for me.. . There were also two egregious service missteps that were so over the top that they became a running joke during the meal:. 1) The "water-waiter" (one guy who only poured and re-filled water glasses) literally splashed water all over the table every time he poured, trying to show off how he could hit the glass with the pitcher poised 3 feet above it.  He couldn't.. 2) The "description waiter" (one guy whose only job was to describe the preparation of each dish) was absolutely unintelligible.  English was at best his 2nd language (sounded more like 4th to us), and despite us listening intently and him speaking VERY loudly, we had no idea what we were eating most of the time.  . . Amazing faux-pas, considering the reputation of the place and the guy who owns it.  . . We actually e-mailed the restaurant after the fact, and they replied with an apology and a gift certificate, which was nice.  However, the GC can't be used on Saturday nights, making it all-but-worthless for us suburbanites.. . When all is said and done, we won't go back, GC or not.
