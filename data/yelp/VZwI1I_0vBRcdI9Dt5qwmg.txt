Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
When I came here with my fiance, we got pretty lucky. Normally I'm told that the wait to sit down is pretty long. But when we got there, it was just the right timing, and the party that was in front of us disappeared, so we sat down right away. We were pretty hungry but were told that the pizza would be really filling. So we decided not to order appetizers. First mistake! Expect to wait about 40 minutes to get your pizza. We were starving by the time our pizza finally came. We ordered the medium, which said it fed about 2-3 people. Second mistake! It easily could have served 4 people...easily. I can normally eat a lot, but even I struggle to finish the second slice. My fiance of course could not finish one slice. The pizza layer is so thick and there's just so much cheese on it. The pizza itself tasted really good, but just way too much cheese. When I glanced over at the table to my right, I could not help but to laugh. They had ordered 5 medium pizzas with appetizers for a party of 8...gooood luck with that! Overall, the long wait kind of ruined the experience, and I personally hate wasting food. So the restaurant needs to change their menu to better reflect the estimate of the number of people a certain sized pizza can serve instead of underestimating so they can sell more pizzas.
