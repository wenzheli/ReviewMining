Restaurant: Sushi X
Category: Sushi Bars
I've only been to Sushi X once and can't believe I haven't been back because I thought it was great. It was some of the best sushi I've had (which surprised me since it looked sketchy when we went in the restaurant) and the cost of dinner was very reasonable.  I remember the rolls being absolutely huge and I could hardly finish 2 (and I always finish my sushi). I'm going to have to try this place again soon- I hope it's as good as I remember.
