Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
On top of the fact that deep dish pizza isn't even pizza (it's a casserole! a freakin' CASSEROLE!), this Giordano's is always packed and the service is mediocre. I don't care if your restaurant is super busy and you're serving celebrities or if you're serving six people during a slow hour - I expect service to be friendly and prompt either way. I didn't really get the impression that the waitstaff here wanted anything to do with me or my friends who were hungry. This particular waiter would never smile and would scoff at our requests. It certainly wasn't a pleasant experience service-wise.. . But, because this Giordano's is near the Loop, it's always buzzing with activity and makes for a good space to socialize and eat with family and friends in a big group. Definitely perfect for out-of-towners wanting a taste of Chicago. Just expect to wait at least an hour on the weekends to get in and get seated. Oh, and you'll have to wait another hour for your pizza casserole to arrive at your table.
