Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
I love Tank!  It's often packed but even on days when you can't get a seat without waiting, they'll ask if you'd like to sit at a table of other "irregular" customers that were all seated together because there was no room elsewhere.  Interesting way to meet new people for certain!. . The food is great, spring rolls and beef pho are the best I've had in the city and the #1 appetizer is an insane portion of good food.  It'd be a five star if the place were a little cleaner (I'm not fond of the bathroom, but I have no qualms about the utensils), and the service isn't always attentive.
