I felt like I was in a Tommy Bahama boutique. I was really hoping to see someone in one of those 'famous'-yet atrocious short sleeve shirts; but no such luck.  For the most part, I was not too impressed with this place. The entrees are the standard American version of Vietnamese food. The Ca Chien Saigon (aka: crisp seared red snapper) did not meet up to what I thought it would be. The fish was not "crisp" and the chef seasoned the sauce with too much fish sauce. The Mi Xao Do Bien (aka: seafood vegetable stir-fry in oyster sauce) is essentially your low man food on the menu. Just because you add cilantro, lemongrass, or lime wedges to entrees do not make it Vietnamese. And let's remember the French was not kind to Vietnam when they wanted to be there own country.
