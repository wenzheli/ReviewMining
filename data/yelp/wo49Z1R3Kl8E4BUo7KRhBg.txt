First off, both the sweet and savory crepes were good. They tasted fresh with tons of  flavor. I don't know about what other people are used to but I didn't think the portion size was all that big/filling. I think you can get more food for the money over at Reza's (quality too).. . The atmosphere was interesting, and they put something into the presentation of the food. Overall  things were fine, pretty good, but nothing special. Maybe from the reviews I was expecting more, to be wowed, but I wasn't. Personally, I didn't think the prices were high given how they are trying to offer a unique experience, in detail. . . I doubt I'll be back (especially not if I'm really hungry). Not a bad food experience but  I've experienced better crepes, and many times over-better Middle Eastern food.
