Carne Asada tacos are amazing.  All you need is a little cilantro, onion and some green sauce (optional), and you have one of the best tacos in the city.. . The Carne Asada is really well spiced, flavorful and best of all, almost always freshly grilled.  This last point makes all the difference between a standard taqueria taco and La Pasadita's Carne Asada.. . Enjoy.
