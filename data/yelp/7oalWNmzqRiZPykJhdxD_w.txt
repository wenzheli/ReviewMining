Restaurant: Gino&#39;s East
Category: Pizza
I liked the old building better, but am glad to see that Gino's is back in its Superior location.. . Service is spotty, and it takes a long time for the pizza to be prepared.  It's worth the wait.  Order a goddamn appetizer (fried ravioli, anyone?), be patient, and enjoy conversing with your friends (if you have any).. . On to the pizza.  Love the cornmeal crust!  Order a pizza with sausage patty  (not crumbled, for fuck's sake).  The sausage patty is the size of the pizza!  Fresh mozzarella cheese!   Awesome sauce!  . . You can't go wrong by going to any of the other pizza places in Chicago (Uno was outstanding, even!), but Gino's is my favorite.
