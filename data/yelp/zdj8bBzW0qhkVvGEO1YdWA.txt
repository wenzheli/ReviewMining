We tried this cafe with some friends on a Saturday night around 7pm. The ambiance is calm, the walls red, and the place wasn't too crowded. Service was somewhat sporadic;  we waited several minutes at every turn (menus, water, order, dessert, check) but the food was fantastic. The menu features few veggie friendly options. I ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer with mashed plantains. Even with a healthy appetite, I found these two appetizers adequate as a meal. The vanilla bean gelato was average, but the decent decaf coffee was only a dollar. I'd go back in a social setting or with friends who loved it, but I doubt it'll be a regular hangout, and certainly not a go-to place.
