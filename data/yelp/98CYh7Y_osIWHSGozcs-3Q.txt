Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
My favorite place to eat in Lincoln Park. I would eat here 4 times a week in college and now visit a couple times a year since graduating. . . I'm Italian born and raised and pasta was a staple in our weekly menu. This is the best pasta beside homemade that I've found for $7 or less.. . My favorite dish is the Gnocchi in Rosemary Gorgonzola cheese. YUMMY!! I also enjoy the cheese bread and bruschetta.
