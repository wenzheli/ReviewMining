Restaurant: Icosium Kafé
Category: Creperies
My crepe was very good.  Had a lovely atmosphere however, I thought that I was walking into more of a restaurant/cafe than a crepe cafe.  If Icosium would have their menu posted outside or a sign that said the only sold crepes, perhaps I would have appreciated Icosium even more.  Nevertheless, the do make very good crepes.
