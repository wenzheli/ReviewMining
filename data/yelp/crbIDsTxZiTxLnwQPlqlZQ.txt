This is my new favorite brunch/breakfast spot, and I have never had a problem with service here, despite what other reviews say. If you aren't getting good service try sitting at the counter, they will never stop refilling your coffee.. . I have only eaten brunch here, but I've never had a problem with a wait -- it's never been more than 10 minutes, even with 3 people on a Sunday. Maybe they like me, or maybe they recognize their regulars? . . The New Orleans scramble is delicious, the chocolate chip, apple, and blueberry pancakes are too, as is the french toast and the hash browns. Eventually I will get an omelette here, but I can't comment on those now. I love that they have tons of sugary cereals available, the coffee is good, and the prices and portions are very reasonable. I just wish they had bagels.
