Pros: . The Pecan Sundae was the best desert I've ever ever ever had in my life. I will return to this restaurant for more deserts and to try other dinner menu items. Super friendly and prompt service. Cozy and upscale feeling. . . Con[ish]s: . Saturday night at 7pm, 1.5 hour wait. Make reservations!. . My sister and I dined here as I insisted on trying the Fried Chicken and cheddar waffle after reading a favorable review of this dish in a recent issue of TONY. I've experienced the not so glam chicken &amp; waffles (which I love) and wondered what the gourmet version might compare. I must say I was disappointed. The helping was hardy, but the chicken coating lacked flavor and both of ours came slightly over cooked/a little crispier than desired. The waffle looked good and was an adequate accompaniment but I could not taste the cheddar at all. The slaw had a distinct taste of mayo which is also disappointing.
