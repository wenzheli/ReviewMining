Heavenly is the only way to describe the pizza here!  I was there with a group of six girls and we devoured the pizza (2 red and 2 white) and the antipasti.  The prosciutto and melon and the prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella literally melt in your mouth.  The pizza's have the perfect crust and the freshest ingredients.  The wait was minimal (even for a table for six) and they let us linger at the table enjoying the food, wine and company.  I will definitely be a regular.
