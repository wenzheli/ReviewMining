Restaurant: Gino&#39;s East
Category: Pizza
I didn't know how many locations Gino's East had until I decided to review it, so their authenticity kinda went down a notch immediately upon realizing it's pretty much a local chain and not really a singular 'institution.'. . The place is visually interesting inside, with basically every surface covered in tourist scribbles ... I guess the restaurant thinks they're hip or something because of this. I personally found it a bit corny and was frustrated at the lack of artistic talent in general. We ordered a big deep dish with half pepperoni and half 'famous sausage' (crumbled). Understandably, and with warning from the server, the pizza arrived at the table about forty minutes after ordering it.. . It was good, don't get me wrong, but I don't know if I'm totally sold on the Chicago deep-dish style thing.
