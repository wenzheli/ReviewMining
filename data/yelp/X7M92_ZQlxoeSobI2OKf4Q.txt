I came here with an old friend on Saturday afternoon for lunch, and we had a great time and would definitely come back. Our waitress was very attentive - potentially too much, as several times we had to ask for a few more minutes for her to take orders - drinks, pizza, dessert, etc. I love that they have the San Pellegrino sparkling juices - limonata and aranciata are not that easy to find, so I enjoyed my aranciata thoroughly! We decided to get two pizzas and split them, and both of them ended up being the "blanca" style, so I can't comment on the sauce. But we got the sausage and rapini pizza and the prosciutto and arugula pizza. I think both of us preferred the prosciutto one, but I wouldn't ever say no to either of them. The crust was outstanding - I'll need to go here with someone who doesn't eat the "handle" (crust-only) part of the pizza so that I can eat it. I could probably survive on that wood-fired crust forever.... . Atmosphere is cute and casual - I thought the chairs were a little uncomfortable, but I liked the bright paint on the wall and how sunny it felt indoors. I would definitely go back to Spacca Napoli in a heartbeat!
