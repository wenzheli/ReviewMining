Food here is good, always! Service needs some serious reconsideration. During my last visit, I was seated after about 15 min, even though they were not busy. I wasn't given the menu, so after about 10 minutes, I got up and went to the counter to get the menu. After some more waiting, I had to ask the passing waiter (who totally ignored me the first 5 times he passed me by) to take my order. I think their fame and fortune got to their head. White people are getting serviced, viet people are getting serviced, but a brown person cannot get her order taken. WTF???
