Wow -- I went here and had the 24 course meal.  Holy crap is that a lot of food even though each course is a bite or two.. . Here's a piece of advice, don't down a bottle of champagne with your friend before you get here -- I made that mistake and was pretty tipsy -- asking the waiter (who I'm SURE hated me) if every course was an 'amuse bouche'. . . The food was very unique and delicious.  If I were to go back, I'd get the 12 course -- 24 was way too much for me.  Also, if you don't like white wine (I personally hate it) -- don't get the wine pairing.  Most of it was white wine and therefore I didn't drink most of it. . . The decor is really cool and while waiting for my friend to use the restroom before we left I got to watch the kitchen staff running around the kitchen like a well oiled machine. . . Love Alinea -- hope to go back soon. :)
