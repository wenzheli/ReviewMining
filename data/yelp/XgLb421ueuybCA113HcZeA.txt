I came here for a work dinner and actually expected to hate it, but was very pleasantly surprised.  I usually don't like the all-you-can-eat steakhouses, but this one is much different.  Of course, it's still all you can eat (and I over-ate), but they don't just serve meat; there was also salmon, duck, pork, etc.  For a place that makes so many different kinds of food, everything I had was great.  I was especially surprised that things like the salmon and duck were perfectly cooked.  Everything also was well-seasoned (unlike Brazzaz...).  . . The "harvest tables" are a huge step up from the tacky salad bar you usually see at these places.  It had things like roasted cauliflower with pecan sauce and lobster bisque.  Everything was beautifully presented.  . . I also can't forget the sides they put out at the table.  They put out a macaroni and cheese that was the BEST I've ever had.  I couldn't stop eating it.... . The downsides were that the service was pretty bad initially (it took way too long for our drinks to arrive).  It's also way too much food, but if you're ever REALLY hungry, it's definitely worth a try.  It's also worth coming here for just the delicious drinks and beautiful roofdeck.
