I like it. I came here during the summer once with my parents for a "light lunch." We sat outside and shared the sweet potato fries with goat cheese fondue (perfect) and I also had a salad. The sweet potato fries were the best I've ever had; not at all soggy or greasy. And that goat cheese. God. So delicious. The salad was okay, it got kind of boring after I got over how giant it was.. . I went again in the fall for dinner and was really impressed with their seasonal menu. If I had died during dinner, I would've died happy. Sitting in a nice cozy spot next to the fireplace, I had the pumpkin ravioli with gorgonzola cheese sauce and it was...just...I mean...amazing. The pumpkin was a little bit sweet and the gorgonzola was just the right amount of salty (okay, maybe a little bit more than "just the right amount," but still great). My boyfriend Shawn had the mac &amp; cheese. It was hot, but other than that it was just mac &amp; cheese. . . A little pricey for what it is and the service isn't speedy by any means, but definitely friendly. Hopefully I'll go back soon and taste what's new.
