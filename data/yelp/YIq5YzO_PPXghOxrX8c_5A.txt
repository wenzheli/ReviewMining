Not being a fan of food thats not in the range of spicy to crazy-spicy, I've always considered pasta dishes too bland for me to enjoy. Being vegetarian also narrows the options to marinara and such. . . And then I landed up at Calo once I moved into the neighborhood. Since then, this has become my go-to spot for anything Italian and for Saturday nights with friends.. . . Good wine, good food, huge portions, great service and wonderful ambience (you even get to pick which room you sit in - the lovely dining area or the booth/bar scene with the TVs). This one sure is a keeper :)
