Restaurant: Greek Islands Restaurant
Category: Greek
This is my favorite restaurant in the WORLD. I've been going here since I was like 14 and I never make a trip to Illinois without stopping here. I can spend $50-60 here on lunch for myself and that's hard to do considering the prices are very reasonable.. . The experience starts right when you enter. From the way you are greeted, you can tell that this is still a family business, even though the restaurant is the size of a quarter city block. The restaurant is laid out very interestingly and about 8 years ago or so, they remodeled and added tiered seating, which is definitely unique. They are have some areas for decent sized groups, but you can feel either very romantic or like you are sitting in a crowded European cafe, depending on where you are sat.. . The food is wonderful and many of my favorite dishes call this their home. The lamb chops spectacular. If this is your first trip and you are on speaking terms with lamb, do not miss your chance to eat these before you die. In fact, new words should be invented to describe them. Their dolmades are pure heaven and I've never been to another greek place that even serves them this way, let alone this deliciously. Most Greek restaurants serve them cold. However, at the Islands, you get them hot and (although they are smaller now) they are nearly the size of a burrito and covered in a divine white sauce. This is one of the rare things that I've tried to imitate at home and just can't make as well as the restaurant.. . This is a great place for a business meeting, a quiet dinner with the family or to impress a date. As another review mentioned they pride themselves on their service, which is icing on a scrumptuous cake.. . Oopa!
