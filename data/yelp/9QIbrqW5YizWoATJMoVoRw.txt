I like the upstairs more than the downstairs.  It's more casual and a great place to get some rice and a dessert late night.  . . I want to make a note of how nice one of the bartenders there is.  Cute little girl that gave my blind date attitude when he showed up fifteen minutes late.  Thank you!   He ordered a bottle of champagne and she filled his flute higher than mine each time she lifted the bottle.  Good Lookin' out sweetie!. . I've had dinner here downstairs with a large group of friends and the service there was excellent as well.  Good, fresh food.  The bathroom is upstairs and nothing to note.
