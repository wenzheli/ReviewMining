We thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Greek Islands. The food was wonderful and very filling.  We started off with the Saganaki--yummy! (it was fun seeing little bursts of flames occurring throughout the restaurant).  . Then we had the gyros and mousaka. Both dishes were delicious. For me, the tzatski was the best I've ever tasted.  And ok, I'm going to sound a little weird but the potato that the served with the mousaka--heaven.  Yes, I'm getting excited about a potato.  Great portions of food--had leftovers for home (yay!). . The service was wonderful.  Very friendly and most especially very attentive.  They seemed to anticipate what we needed.   Free valet is a plus--and those guys hustle.  It was raining pretty hard but the guys did a great job getting everyone's car back in a very timely manner.
