Amazing meats, amazing salad bar, amazing place overall.  I've been to Chicago three times, and eaten here twice.  Both times, I was blown away by the food (I'm a steak snob and thus a churrascuria cynic, and yet the meat here was still delicious to me), the service, and the overall atmosphere.. . Don't know about Fogo, but Espetus in SF doesn't have nearly the salad bar selection this place has.  By salad bar, I also mean the calamari salad, shrimp cocktail, and oysters on the half shell.  All you can eat.. . Fantastic.
