I've always wanted to check out Glenn's Diner after all I've heard about it, and it definitely lived up to its reputation! I went for lunch and I had the seafood salad and my friend had the Caesar salad. Both were very good but if you don't like Parmesan cheese, don't get the Caesar! Lucky for us we both love Parmesan so we were happy campers. We shared the mussels and split the mushroom soup beforehand and both were absolutely amazing!!! Highly recommend both of those. One thing I'd say is that a lot of their fish options aren't very 'light' so if you are looking for a healthy light meal this is not the place to go, however your taste buds won't regret your venture through its doors. The service was also not the best, but not bad enough to keep me from coming back.
