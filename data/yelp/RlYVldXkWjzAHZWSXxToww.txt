Impecable service, great presentation. Do not look at this as just dinner, this is an experience everyone should have at least once in their lifetime. It's very expensive but that's a given. Wine pairing choices were mostly good except for a couple I didn't care for that much, nonetheless this place deserves its 5 stars. It's worth all the hype. There's no bar so if you are waiting for someone go next door to Boca, they have a nice selection.
