Positives: The food was great and reasonably priced for a nice restaurant. We started with Cha Gio (egg rolls) and my only thought was that I wanted more. My wife had the salmon (Ca Nuong) and I had a chicken dish with portobello mushrooms and chili "sauce" (Ga xao xa ot)The martinis were pretty great (Lemongrass) and the dessert we ordered (Vanilla ice cream on a great coconut crust) was a fantastic ending. The decor of the place is pretty cool and the service was very good.. . Negatives: We went for our anniversary and were expecting a romantic experience. Unfortunately, we were sat against a wall ON TOP of four other groups. We heard every single word of every single conversation. I guess we were hoping to enjoy one another instead of listening to bullshit discussions from random groups of people. We went on a Saturday night, so maybe that's just to be expected. I read another review about how this would be a good first date place. I actually agree since if things aren't going well you can just sit back and people watch (and listen).. . All in all, good experience, good food...we will go (not rush) back.
