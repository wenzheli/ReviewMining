Take your out-of-towners here.  It's a great gourmet pizza place with so many interesting combinations and a relaxing atmosphere.  I had the Salsiccia e Broccoletti pizza, which was great.  I tried other things and they were all good, too.  The pizza is priced right (I think it was $11) and is really intended for one person, not two.  However, if you got an appetizer or two, one pizza would work for two people.. . I felt the desserts were overpriced by about 40% and were wayyyy too small.  Skip the desserts here.
