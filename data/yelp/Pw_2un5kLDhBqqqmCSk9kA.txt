Category: Creperies
Went to Icosium for my wife's birthday and pretty happy with my meal.  The savory crepe was delicious (I think I had the Palace Crepe) when I added lamb sausage.  My only complaint was that there wasn't much sausage added for $3.. . I was impressed.  Soup, followed by a great crepe with a cup of flavored iced tea followed by half of a dessert was $20 per person.  Add in the fun decor and you've got a great casual dinner before you hit the bars etc.
