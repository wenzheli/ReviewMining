The food is good but the service is awful. I went there with two guests from out of town, so a party of 4 total, including entrees and wine. Our waitress never once checked on us, she never refilled our wine, after the bill came and was paid them came by twice to hustle us out of there, and as we were standing up the cleaning crew swooped in and before we could give them space PUSHED me to one side to clear glasses and napkins. Horrible horrible service. I'd steer clear
