One of the best. Even better that it's a BYOB! The portions are huge! Would suggest the Matrimonio. It's a huge plate of strip steak, chicken breast, plantain, yucca and a small baked potato. More than enough to fill you up. My favorite though has to be the Lengua en salsa de alcaparras (aka beef tongue in spanish capers sauce). Amazing!. . There's always a wait on weekend evenings, so service can be a bit lacking on a busy night. Weeknights are better. Looks like though management has opened up a satellite location a couple doors down in a larger space. It includes 2 bars and a HUGE waiting area, probably to make up for the lack of space in the original spot. So now you don't have an excuse not to try it out!
