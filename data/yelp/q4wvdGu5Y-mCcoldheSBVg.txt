My first Brazilian steakhouse was a success!  All the meats were cooked to perfection.  I love how each slab of meat contained your preference of cooking - whether it'be medium or rare.  Each type had its distinct taste that makes you yearn for more.  Located a few blocks from Fogo, which by the way is cheaper in price than Fogo.  Ambience is great, and service is impecable.  They even have complimentary valet durin lunch hours.. . I will definitely go back!  Can't wait!
