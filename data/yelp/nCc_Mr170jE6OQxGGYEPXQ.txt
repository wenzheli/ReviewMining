ABSOLUTELY AWFUL SERVICE. Went in on a Friday at 9:15am. Table for 2. 15 minute wait - fine, no big deal. Sit down at our incredibly drafty table (get a revolving door people - half the tables get blasted with cold lakefront air every time the door opens). 5 minutes later the server comes. We order coffee and our entrees right off the bat. 5 minutes later we get our coffee. 5 minutes later we finish our coffee and want refills, as is customary at any halfway decent breakfast place. NO SERVER TO BE FOUND. OUR MUGS WERE EMPTY FOR AT LEAST 10 MINUTES. Now conversation has ceased between the two of us as all of our energy is spent on desperately locating more caffeine. I come to realize that an empty little white restaurant coffee cup is one of the most depressing sights I've ever seen. Not that I've ever seen it before, since every breakfast place I've ever been to refills like every 5 seconds. At the 10 minute point we are freaking out, and the bf actually gets up to track someone down. We finally get more coffee, and continue the 40 minute wait for our food. I have NEVER seen a breakfast place take that long with an order. . . Food was ok. Not worth dealing with the service though. Ugh. With the plethora of awesome breakfast places in this city, I can't say I'll ever be back to Yolk.
