Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
I thought this was the best chicago style pizza I've ever had.  I even took a pie home for the family to taste it was so good. (And BTW, the pizza traveled very well back to San Diego - not exactly the same as eating at the restaurant, but close). I ordered the pizza the day before I was leaving, and they freeze the pizza and packed it with some dry ice for the flight home.  This location is so convenient if you're doing some shopping in the area.  I'd be back the next time we're here. Delicious.
