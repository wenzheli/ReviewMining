Restaurant: Sun Wah Bar-B-Que
Category: Chinese
I've been MIA on Yelp. Know why? I have the Sun Wah fever.. My Director introduce this place to me and I got hooked with the food. Have I mention I'm big on Asian food? Well this promise the taste Roast Duck, Roast Pork, BBQ pork, Roast chicken from Hong Kong. If you ever have the taste for it, you don't need to go all the way down to Chinatown cause this place is so much better !!!. . The price? Cheaper than you thought!! A big plate of roast duck rice with vege &amp; salted egg only cost $5. Where can you get that?? Now, I can forget gourmet.. I only have Sun Wah in my head.. Typing this review makes wanting it more.
