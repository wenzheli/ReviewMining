Tru-ly amazing.. . Food: out of this world. We had a regular and a vegetarian menu so that we could have variety (why is it that these places' tasting menus are usually the same?) , and left sated and stuffed. . . What truly dazzled me about this experience though was the service. Everything was done "in tandem". Two waiters attended to everything. Each of our water glasses were refilled at the same time. Each of our courses were placed in front of us at the same time. Each of our drinks were placed in front of us at the same time. Etcetera. We felt like royalty. . . Don't get me wrong, they charge royal prices but if you are up for a splurge, in my book it's worth it.
