I love Wilde.  I've been eating, drinking, and generally hanging out at Wilde since they opened but I'm glad I waited until now to write a review.  The fact that it's only 2 minutes from my place aside, I was going to scream and rip my hair out if one more Asian/Fishy/Thai/Noodle place opened up on Broadway.  I needed something new and Wilde was a good change.. . Like any new place, Wilde had some growing pains in the beginning and many issues to work through before they got it right.  But judging from my experiences there lately I think there's been major improvement.  When Wilde first opened the service was slow, the staff/servers were chilly at best, and the food was mediocre.  But lately I haven't experienced any of that.  Aside from the fact that I think the bar is beautiful and love that the restaurant decorated for Fall, the service seems to have improved and the food has gotten better; Mac &amp; Cheese, YUM!  But I'm especially in love with their brunch.  Their waffles are fantastic and the Wilde Benedict is one of my absolute favorite benedicts I've ever tried.. . While the attitude of the servers seems to have improved my only gripe is with the Host/Hostess.  They are NEVER friendly when you walk in, and thus, I can't in good conscience give Wilde five stars.  Oh, and I generally try to avoid Wilde during any televised sports event because it is then that Wilde seems to have an identity crisis and turns into a wannabe sports bar.  Other than that, I love it here, and I'm glad to have it in the hood.
