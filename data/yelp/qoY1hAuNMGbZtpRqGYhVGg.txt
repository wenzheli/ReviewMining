I highly recommend the honey jalapeno pork chops.  You get a platter of two very large char grilled pork chops over a mound of mashed sweet potatoes.  There is plenty to share or to take home leftovers.  Our waiter, Klei, recommended the pork chops over the other pork dishes and boy, was I glad I took him up on it.  The only problem was that the sweet potatoes were more room temperature than hot.  Klei offered to bring more, hotter sweet potatoes.  He was very knowledgeable of the menu and very attentive, as was the rest of the wait staff.  The chorizo stuffed bacon wrapped dates were a wonderful way to start our meal.  I also recommend you do the same.  Bon Appetito!!!
