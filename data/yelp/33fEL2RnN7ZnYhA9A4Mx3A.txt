Category: Pizza
I asked our waiter where they got their buffalo mozzarella, because I cook with mozzarella enough to recognize the best damn product available.  His response?  Italy.  . . Although I was disappointed that I couldn't source my cheese from the same place they do, the disappointment stopped there.  . . Had a miracle experience here, where we arrived on a cold and snowy night with a line out the door - we prepared for a long wait... but we were the only party of two waiting in a crowd of what must have been 20-30 people and we were whisked to our table!!!  I didn't ask questions, but rather immediately ordered beer, wine and a bounty of delicious bread cheese, and melted cheese on bread with ingredients just as good and fresh as the aforementioned mozzarella on something called "pizza".  . . I'm starting to get spoiled by all the insanely good authentic Italian pizza around here - among D.O.C., I Monelli, Antica Pizzeria - Spacca Napoli stands near the top if not the best.  . . I'd probably try to avoid the crowds, but to be honest it would be worth the wait.
