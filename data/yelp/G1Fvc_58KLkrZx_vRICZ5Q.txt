4-5 stars.... Seriously....?  . . Oh yay they have a patio on a dirty street under the El and they're on Montrose where we've not been able to get any other good restaurants.. . Look-  They have fish (that they don't season), they put raw red onions on everything, they're breakfast sucks, and they mess up your order 3 times out of 4.  Save your money and get a Ben and Jerry's from the convenience store next door, or go to Scott's and bring a bag of Doritos.. . Do they still do that bottomless cereal bowl?  lame.. . Le Sabre is better and 1/2 the price.
