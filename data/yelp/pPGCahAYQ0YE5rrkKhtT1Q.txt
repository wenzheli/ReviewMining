Went here last weekend with a friend.  I was starving just getting off of work and told her i want a bar thats quick with their food and it was right by her place.  . . It wasn't too packed at around 11:30pm.  We walked to the back and found a table near the fireplace.  It was nice and cozy.  The decor was nice and the people seemed very friendly.  It was fun to people watch in this place.  . . On to the food.  I had wilde burger which was damn good.  I haven't had a great burger like this since I went to RAM in schaumburg.  I asked for a medium rare burger and I received my medium rare burger perfectly cooked.  The bun was nicely toasted.  It also came with fries, coleslaw, and half a pickle?!? . . I also grabbed an amstel light.. . She got a margarita with their Guinness Chocolate cake.  A sweet drink and chocolate cake didnt go well together so I drank the margarita and had some of the cake as my dessert.  Cake wasn't too special, I couldn't tell if there was guinness in the cake or not.  Nevertheless it was a nice cozy place.  . . Would I go there again?  No, once is enough for me.
