Restaurant: Tia Pol
Category: Tapas Bars
Tia Pol has a great intimate atmosphere with its small space, dim lighting, and bar seating near the front of the restaurant.  Great place for a date, or just having a nice conversation with a friend.. . Service was great.  The bartender was friendly and very helpful with recommendations for both wine and food.  My one complaint would probably be that they have a very short list of wines available by the glass.. . Food-wise, the tortilla wasn't horrible, but wasn't that great (although it was better than the one at Bar Jamon).  Sadly, I have yet to find a place in New York that makes a good traditional tortilla.  The squid in ink sauce was decent but not spectacular; the squid was very tender, the rice served with it had a great texture and kind of reminds of sticky rice, but the flavor was not particularly memorable.  However, the patatas bravas were great, with just the right kick of spiciness and the perfect texture, and the chorizo with chocolate, served on a piece of toasted bread and sprinkled with salt and saffron threads was one of the most memorable dishes I had that night.  But the dessert was the true winner- fried custard, served warm with a cool, creamy center, topped with dried cherries soaked in port or sherry or something.  I loved the consistency of the custard juxtaposed against the crunchy breading.  It was the perfect ending to the meal.
