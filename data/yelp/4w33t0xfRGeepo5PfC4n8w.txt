Restaurant: Calo Ristorante
Category: Pizza
Calo's has very solid Italian dishes.  The food is not trendy or pretentious, just good, filling, classic Italian fare.  As expected, they have really great pizza (and feature giardinera as a topping which is a HUGE plus in my opinion).. . That said, I must admit that I miss the OLD Calo's -- the one with the 60's neighborhood pseudo-supper-clubby atmosphere.  It had great character!  On the weekends there was always a band and cute neighborhood couples would trip the light fantastic on the dance floor.. . Now Calo's has been remodeled (actually it was a couple of  years ago) and the remodel is nice.  The problem is that it's just a little too generic-yuppie. Last time I was there, there was a "light jazz" combo (which is OK), but no one was dancing. The "old school" atmosphere is definitely missed (at least by this nostalgic ol' queen!).. . In short, for home-style classic Italian dishes, Calo's know exactly what they're doing (and have been doing it for a long time).
