Restaurant: Calo Ristorante
Category: Pizza
I've been eating from Calo's for as long as I can remember.  My grandmother lived right over on Racher and Ashland so we frequently ordered from them.  The food was always good although I usually either got pizza or pasta.  Occasionaly I would get the chicken or ribs and I was never disapointed.. . I can't say much about thier interior remodelings as I've ever only been inside three times in my life.  The first when I was six and the last two times were on Valentines Day last  year and 6 months after that.  The Valentines visit was amazing.  We had a lovely table by the window and the candles on the table were wonderful.  I was also very pleased with the service.  If only other places could be as good with thier customer service.  It's kind of a long trip  for me to get to these days but I still enjoy going.
