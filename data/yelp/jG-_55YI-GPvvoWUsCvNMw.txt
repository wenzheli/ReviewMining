This is no traditional sushi joint. They have a roll called 5-0 that's made with two types of bacon. Not something I would advertise as "sushi" but I have to admit. It was pretty damn good. I guess it's hard to go wrong with Bacon, prosciutto, and wasabi mayo. . . We ordered Miso soup and edamame to get started. The soup was decent, the edamame was a heaping portion. . . It would have been nice to have options other than rolls on the menu. There are only rolls. But it seems they are taking the approach of doing one thing, and doing it well. . . There were 4 of us and we ordered 2 rolls each thinking that we'd order more after the first round. HOLY CRAP THESE ROLLS ARE HUGE! We had a hard time finishing them. . . The happy hour specials are amazing. You get half off most rolls as long as you are seated by 7pm. We got 8 rolls, edamame, and miso soup. Our bill was somwhere around $60 for the four of us and we were stuffed to the Gills. (pun intended). . This is another BYOB joint which I am really starting to appreciate.
