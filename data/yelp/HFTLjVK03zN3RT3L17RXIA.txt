YAY!  MORE THAI!. . I thought Hyde Park had its problems with too much Thai Joints, but, well, they don't call Chicago the Second City for nothing, we again and again surmise.. . But, hey, this place is one of the better ones out there.  I can't even place it in my mind, in terms of its geographical location in the physical world, but it's definitely the best I've had in the BK.*. . If it weren't so popular that you didn't have to wait to be seated, and not in Cobble but Clinton Hill, I would give it a 4-Star.. . * I may add to this eventually, but Thai Restaurants I've tried in the BK are all on the same f'ing block (Myrtle).  Yes, Hyde Park and Clinton Hill share a secret bond that can only be interpersonally related to via the movie, Twin Falls Idaho.**. . ** Rent it on VHS to simulate the atmosphere of the 90's.
