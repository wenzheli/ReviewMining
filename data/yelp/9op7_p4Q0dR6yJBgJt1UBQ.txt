I stopped in after an event in Grant Park. It was a cold &amp; rainy spring morning, so I expected a lighter brunch crowd but the place was packed inside with people waiting for tables. We had a party of 3 and ended up waiting maybe 1/2 hour for a table, so not a terrible wait. Although I don't think I would go back on a nice day between 9-12, I have a feeling the line would have been out the door and around the block.. . The food was good, but it was also your standard brunch fair, nothing to make it stand out from a dozen other brunch spots in the city. The portion sizes were big though which I like, so plenty for sharing or leftovers. The service was a little slow, and given that it was packed and people were waiting, I was a bit surprised by that. I figured it would be very fast so they could move people through quickly to free up tables. . . If I'm in the neighborhood again, I would definitely stop in. But I can't say I'll go out of my way to have brunch here. There are other spots much closer to home with the same or better quality of food where I won't fear I'll have to wait an hour or two just to get seated!
