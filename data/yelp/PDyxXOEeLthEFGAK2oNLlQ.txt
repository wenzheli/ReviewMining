Restaurant: Uncommon Ground
Category: American (New)
going to uncommon ground does so much good for my soul. i want to open up there and let my senses breathe. the atmosphere is so comfortable and fun, the food is bold and flavorful, the music is sweet and lively. this is a place of pure genius. . . i wont tell you what to order (mediterranean trio, chili calamari, espresso-rubbed buffalo steak with onion marmalade...and the gelato...). . go there with an open mind and a clean palate and let lucas the waiter serve you clean and extraordinary flavors.  . . this is a dining experience you'll want to share with someone you like.
