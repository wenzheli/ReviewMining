This is probably my favorite restaurant in the city. The service is good, and so friendly, the atmosphere is pleasant and casual yet refined. The food is amazing, try the lasagna, (seriously...try it), either the meat or the one with bechamel and musrooms, it's individually made, slightly crsip and top and perfect. The first time I went there was in February, the warm lighiting and hearty delicious lasagna made me alsmost forget It was like 2 degress outside and I got blasted with eyeball freezing wind on my way in. The one thing I don't understand is why it's not more crowded (better for me I guess) I have never had to wait, and also have never seen a soul in either of the back dining rooms.
