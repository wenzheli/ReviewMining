I like this place a lot.  We arrived at about 9.00 PM and no tables were available for our party of six.  However, there were two of the taller cafe tables available and we asked the greeter if they could be pushed together for us.  He said if we would be comfortable there, no problem, and set the tables up for us.  He was friendly and cordial, as was the rest of the staff.  We had coffees and desserts and they were first rate--the latte I had was the best one I've had in ages and the Valprona chocolate pastry was very tasty, incredibly rich with a very satisfying texture and taste.  The room is very comfortable.  It's big with a mezzanine level above, along the street side.  The decor is warm, with lots of woods and exposed brick.  The crowd at this time of the evening was pretty easy on the eyes too, lots of twenty-somethings and a smattering of smart looking older folks too.. . Parking is a pain in the ass on Saturday night in this neighborhood, although there were plenty of spaces a couple of blocks to the west.. . All in all, I can highly recommend the place.
