Interesting dining experience.  We sat in the dining room on a high-top table abutting the fireplace (so it got a little warm).  Very cheery and helful service, but the place was over 1/2 empty on this Wednesday before Thanksgiving.  The many options on the expansive Salad/Pasta/Veggy Bar were for the most part good.  A few did not agree with the five of us at the table, but that is to be expected.  Not everyone can agree on all foods.. . The highlight of the Brazilian Style of service (where they bring the meats and fish to your table on a big skewer) was the Butter Beef.  Tasted like Heaven.  The Mahi Mahi also great.  A lot of oohing and aahing at the table, but not everything was oh-my-gosh.  You have to try each to see what you like, with some more memorable than others.  I liked my Grape Martini.  My wife thought her Lemon Drop Martini was a bit odd tasting.. . We shared the Butterscotch Bread Pudding which met the expectations of the waitress who described it.  It was a birthday dinner, so one of the Puddings was served with candle on a plate with happy birthday spelled out in chocolate (nice touch).. . Given the focus on all-you-can-eat here, we may come here for a large group event (from time to time) but not on a regular basis if it's just the two of us.  At least not for the full menu option (about $55, I think).  The bar menu offers a scaled down, plated version of the meats for under $20 and I might opt for that next time.  Beautiful and comfy decor in bar area.
