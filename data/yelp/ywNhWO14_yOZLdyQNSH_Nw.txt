Thank God for Wilde. I have been drowning in a sea of Asian, Pan-Asian, Thai, Japanese, Chinese, and dive bars. Wilde gives me hope that my favorite stretch of Broadway will FINALLY begin to really diversify and invest some time and money into quality food and surroundings.. . TO BEGIN...the atmosphere. Think lovely hotel lobby in Ireland--The Great Southern in Kilarney, if you will. Rich wooden bars, tin ceiling, inlaid tile floors, and, get this, A LIBRARY. With fireplace. I mean, there may be drink specials, but this place AIN'T your recent-college-graduate pickup joint.. . THEN...the service. Prompt. Polite. Knowledgeable. Attractive. All the things that you WISH would be in the bars you frequent on the North side, but very rarely (if ever) are. Sometimes it's nice to feel taken care of, isn't it?. . AFTER THAT...the beer list, mixed drink list, wine list, and menu. Yum, yum, and a little more yum. Diverse. Thorough. Thoughtful. It's a guarantee that everyone in your party will find a drink to make him or her happy, including the one friend that simply WON'T drink beer. Even her.. . So, please, everyone, patronize this place. Our little neighborhood cries out for more such quality eat/booze establishments. Let's give hopefuls the encouragement they need to break into our enclave. Not to mention us enjoying some tasty eats and drinks, right?
