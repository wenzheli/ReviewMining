Restaurant: Alinea
Category: American (New)
From Alice in Wonderland: "Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin; but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever say in my life!". . Alinea takes you down the rabbit hole, turning worlds upside down, clocks backwards, or rather, food on thin air, scents developed from nothing and flavors exploding out of tiny containers. I loved it. I kept expecting our wild haired sommelier to ask, "and who my dear, are you?" since this food clearly knew who it was and where it should be. Alinea is a ride and worth every minute.
