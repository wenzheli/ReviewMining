Restaurant: Gino&#39;s East
Category: Pizza
Chicago deep dish pizza is not quite what I was expecting.  We read some reviews about Gino's and thought this be the best place to go to try the famous dish of the city.  Amongst a group of five girls, we ordered two caesar salads, one order of the garlic sticks, and a large combo deep dish pizza.  The pizza took about 45 minutes to prepare so in the meantime we filled up on the appetizers, which probably wasn't a good idea.. . The salad was pretty good, a little more dressing that I would have liked.  I don't recommend the garlic sticks.  They were not garlicky at all...just sticks of regular bread.  A large pizza was WAY too much for five girls.  We had a little over 1/4th of it left.  The pizza toppings were really good but the crust was a cornbread crust, which made it very difficult to eat.  It was heavy and very hard.  Our server was friendly but nothing really that stood out about him.  On the downside, he is the one who recommended such a big pizza, which at this point still does not make sense unless he thought we looked like five little piggies.. . This place is also a little on the pricey side.  We spent about $80 including gratuity.  In my book, $80 is a bit overboard for pizza but I gues it was cool experience.  There was a long line when we left so obviously this place is doing something right.
