A pretty good Italian style pizza in Chicago. . . The service was good, but I was hoping for a little better pizza based upon the reviews I had heard. Don't get me wrong, the pizza is good, but after eating at places like this all over the country, I was hoping for a bit more.. . I always order the prosciutto and arugula pizza at every Italian pizzeria, so I ordered one here. The crust was really tasty, but the pizza was soggy in the middle. I prefer my crust to remain crispy throughout. I was also able to try the four cheese pizza, which actually was tastier that the prosciutto. . . Also, the restaurant only had bottled iced tea. It was imported from Italian, so I guess that is why they carry it, but I would like to have had plain old brewed iced tea as an option. . . The service was helpful, but a little slow with the water refills.
