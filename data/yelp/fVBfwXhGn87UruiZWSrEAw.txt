Out of 12 courses there are going to be highs and lows.  But the unfortunately I dont remember any of the highs.  There was nothing memorable about the food.  The presentation was excellent and I highly recommend the wine pairing, where they present a story with each of the wines.  However, the food was average and the sequence of the food seemed off.  The best dessert course was artistic...yet they had 2 more dessert courses afterwards that were not merely as impressive artistically and were borderline disgusting.
