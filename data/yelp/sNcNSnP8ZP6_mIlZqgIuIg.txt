I am so, so confused. . . I have no idea which location I am reviewing. Trying to look at a map but that don't even help me. . . Does it even matter?. . I have no idea what  kind of taco I ordered. All I know is that it came with nothing. My taco came WITH NOTHING. What did I miss? I went up to the counter to ask for sour cream. Damn, this ain't no Taco Bell, that's for effin sure. Ugh.. . Maybe it was because I was a vampire that nite, so I didn't get the same respect as others. But what am I missing here!!??
