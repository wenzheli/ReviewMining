Restaurant: Opart Thai House Restaurant
Category: Thai
We were looking for a new thai restaurant to order from and decided to give this a shot. . We ordered a few things. They took about an hour and it was pricey for thai food. There are places on par for less time and less money.. I had shrimp tempura, shumai, panang curry, sticky rice and thai custard.. Shrimp tempura with broccoli, sweet potatoes and green beans was delicious with the sauce. Especially sweet potatoes- what a treat!. The shumai is REALLY shrimpy. I mean, duh, they are shrimp dumplings but I couldn't believe how overwhelming the taste was! . I ordered the panang curry with tofu, and it was super tasty. I get a craving for curry every two months, and this might be the big winner. I disappointed myself by ordering the sticky rice. And when they say sticky, they mean STICKY. It was near impossible to eat! . I liked the thai custard but my roommate flipped for it and said it was really really good! . So ordering is convenient and they are friendly. It is pricier and did take more time, so you may want to try a place that is closer/cheaper.
