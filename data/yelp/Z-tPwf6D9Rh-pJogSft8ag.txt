Meh.  I had high hopes after hearing great things about this place.  The food is... okay... but the prices are ridiculous for the quality.  I ordered a blackened chicken sandwich ($12) and had to fork over about $2 more for sweet potato fries.  The sandwich wasn't bad, but I didn't feel it was anything special.  The fries tasted totally bland -- sweet potato fries should be full of flavor! -- which suggested they had just come out of a frozen bag.  Also, my friend ordered "curry chips" as an appetizer.  They were simply a $4 excuse for ordinary french fries with an unremarkable curry sauce drizzled over.. . What's good about Wilde?  The ambiance, to be sure -- it's very warm and inviting inside.  The server was also very nice and attentive.. . But would I recommend it for anything other than the drink menu (which looked great)?  Probably not, unless I'm in the mood to spend money for mediocre food.
