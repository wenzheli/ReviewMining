o.m.g. the food here was so yummy. service was a little slow (reason it's not five stars), but the food was fantastic, and the space is cute and roomy. and most menu items are between 6.95-7.50, which is awesome. and portions are ample.. . we had the calamari, which was not greasy at all and the small was easily split among three people. they don't have a drinks menu, but they have a full bar so we opted for some white russians which were fine. i got the vegetarian red curry and it was one of the better ones i've tried out here - spicier than red curry usually is, with a good variety of vegetables, and very tasty. i tried my husband's spicy noodles with shrimp and it was delicious - not at all greasy, and the chili basil sauce, though not that spicy, was really good. all in all, it was a win and we will definitely be back.
