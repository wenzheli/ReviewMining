Delicious- you must go. Charming space, smaller than I expected, as it's more of a carry-out place, but very well decorated with lots of thought and consideration. We decided to eat in at the counter, since we drove 20 minutes to get there- thanks to the wonderful reviews on Yelp. . .  I had the Pollo (chicken) dinner, which comes with white rice, black beans and sweet plantains. The plantains were everything that I was hoping for- a perfectly prepared, wonderful sweet balance to the beans and chicken. The chicken and beans were delicately seasoned- not overdone. I also tried the veggie and beef empanadas- those were just ok. As an empanada lover, I have had better and I have had worse. I probably wouldn't order them again. . .  I will definately go back, especially if I'm going to Costco- its right down the street. I talked to the owner about his story of opening up the place- he is very personable and his story is inspiring- just follow your dreams!
