Restaurant: Wilde Bar &amp; Restaurant
Category: Pubs
Dined at the bar this afternoon. (It's always interesting to listen to wait staff belittle management and convey their overall unhappiness with work/life.)  The decor is genuine, warm, cozy but the room is loud.  I think it has great potential once they work out a few kinks.  I had the suggested fish &amp; chips with a pint.  The cod was cooked perfectly and the breading equally so almost a tad doughy.  I'm finding the difference between a "good" restaurant and an "excellent" restaurant is truly the staff's caring effort.  And I believe this stems from management's philosophy or direction.  This is a good restaurant, pub, meeting place or hang out.  With the right management, strategy and direction, it could be great.
