Category: Pizza
Our first stop in Chicago! . We came in pretty early..about 6pmish. The place was packed, loud and looked a little dirty to me. Maybe it was all the writing on the wall....but maybe that's what they were going for. . OK, we ordered 4 pitchers of beer, Combo appetizers, garlic bread and a large Deep dish combo pizza. . Beer: Delicious. of course You can never go wrong with Heineken. . Combo appetizers: consisting of : Calamari, mozzarella sticks and some green things: Ok...a little on the cold side, calamari a little too hard to chew, but its calamari. . Deep dish Pizza: Damn! Its a lot of pizza . . http://www.yelp.com/bi....  . Its was seriously amazing. I could only have one...since we had quite a bit of appetizers. But man....This is one of the reasons why i would come back to Chicago. . . Now for the bad.... . Everything was going great! good food, great company, 3.5 pitchers of beer down.....good buzz going...THEN . a fucken cockroach runs across the freaken table toward my purse! . DAMN IT! . of course I freaken jumped out of my seat and out the door. 20 minutes later...I return sit down (of course on the other side) pay and leave. . . WTF! . . My friends talked to the server. We just let her know that the restaurant was probably roach infested and we made no complaint, just informed her after we paid. . . ::::shivers::: . . Strike one Chicago!
