My friends and family rave about this place as much as many other people do from looking at the postings....so I can't knock it too harshly.  I've been to a number of their locations throughout Chicago.  The place just doesn't do it for me.  I think the crushed tomatoes make the pizza soupy and the Italian sausage is a little weird tasting for me.  Oh...not a big fan of the crust either.  Ends up getting soggy from the extra water from the tomatoes.
