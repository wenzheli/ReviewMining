Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
Cobra Nachoman and I went for Vietnamese because we were craving a hearty and spicy hangover lunch. The place was packed with mostly Vietnamese families, although some hipsters were present as well. . . Positives: quick service, big enough menu to satisfy any palette, fresh smoothies served, $10 can get you a meal, private parking lot in the back, family style seating. Killer Pho. . . Negatives: Found more than a few questionable pieces of "pork" in my noodle dish (#140). . . When I first sat down I said to my date, "this is a place I'd bring Anthony Bourdain." Post meal, I was wishing I had never ventured past the Pho. Reluctant to return.
