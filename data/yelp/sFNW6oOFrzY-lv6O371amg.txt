The pasta here is fantastic.. . Its all handmade, and you can tell.  I've had the Chicken Tortellini and the Lobster Ravoli - both were cooked perfectly.  The menu is always changing, but the ingredients stay constant.  Service is great (all four times I have visited)  . . I would have given it five stars except for the weak wine menu by the glass (bottle menu is extensive).  Also, its a bit of tight squeeze in there.. . All in all, this place is a great italian restaurant and I would highly recommend it...enjoy.
