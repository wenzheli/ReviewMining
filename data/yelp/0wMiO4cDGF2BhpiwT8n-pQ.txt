Let it be stated that rats, disgusting as they may be, are an inevitability in a dense urban area, particularly on a street with at least two dozen restaurants. It happens.. . My guess is that the scruffy environment--bare-bones is too bare-bones to describe it--sours some...good news, then: they are, if you like to eat decor, moving to a new spot in 2009 around the corner on Broadway; looks as if they're doing a complete buildout.. . For those not averse, this undoubtedly the best Chinese food on the N.side and my personal favorite in the city. The BBQ meats are uniformly excellent, particularly the duck, which is available whole in a bargain of a meal at $30: there are, I must say, few pleasures in the Chi greater than a warm soft bao/mantou, stuffed with slivers of vegetables, duck sauce, duck meat, and fatty duck skin--the greatest taco ever.. . Beyond meats, SW is pretty versatile, with my favorite hand-pulled noodles in town--get the egg noodles with seafood and vegetables--excellent vegetable sides (though oddly far more expensive than proteins) and surprisingly fun seafood dishes. THere's even a number of standout chicken dishes--salt-baked or citrus fried are my favs--for your grandmother.
