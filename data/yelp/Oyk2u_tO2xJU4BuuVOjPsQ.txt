I had ordered takeout from here for dinner for me and the bf. We were starving so we went a little overboard. We had ordered 6 pieces of nigiri, 4 rolls, and 2 appetizers all for $80. Yeah...overboard. Delivery took decent amount of time which I guess was good because we got even more hungry for the big feast we were about to get. When we got our order, it seems like we weren't the only ones who thought we went overboard. They gave us 4 pairs of chopstick and a free bottle of sake. Yay to free stuff! What was even more surprising was HOW GOOD the nigiri was. We were really surprised, especially for the price. The sad part is that we just moved and we won't be able to order delivery from here. . . Oh..and we did manage to finish every last piece of food.
