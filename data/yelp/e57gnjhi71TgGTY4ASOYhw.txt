Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
i am sitting here  maybe a block and a half away from  this place  and wondering why i haven't ordered from them lately  and   then  about  hour  later  i figure it all out ...again . . the delivered  food got here  cold   it was supposedly spicy  hot  but  surprisingly  tasteless and  they did not provide plastic ware ( not that i asked for any but ... usually it comes with ). . this is  like the second time that i have ordered there for  delivery and been deeply disappointed  both times by   the long wait and cold food ! . . you 'd  think that they would  want to be fast and fabulous  for me ! i am working  in a position at  a front desk where i recommend  food places  ALL the time to people . i simply will  NOT recommend  Pasta Bowl ...... even the  soda was tepid .... not cold    and the menu says  coke  they give Pepsi .... . what's not to like about Pasta Bowl ???  plenty ! ! . their delivery sucks    i won't bother to go inside to eat ....
