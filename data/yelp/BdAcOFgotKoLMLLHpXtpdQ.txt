Restaurant: Yolk
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Yolk is a good place to go for breakfast-brunch in the area. They have a great variety of dishes and in my experience the service was decent, yet not memorable. Portions are big, so you will be so full that you will pass lunch if you are having breakfast. I tried the Eggs Florentine and my coworker got  "Huevos Rancheros", the were bot really good. The location is great because is across the street from Grant Park, but parking is not that convenient.
