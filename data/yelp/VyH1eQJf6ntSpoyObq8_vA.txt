Meh.. . I went on a Friday around 8pm and the place was mostly dead.  I had a feta and chicken crepe with veggies and it was remarkably bland.  Crepes aren't my favorite food, to be certain, but I just felt like the imaginative combinations listed on the menu didn't play out in practice.. . The Turkish coffee took forever (even longer than other places where I've had Turkish coffee) and tasted a bit off.. . I'd give Icosium a second chance since it's got so many positive reviews, but it'd take a good showing for this to become a place I go to often.
