Restaurant: Glenn&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
I have a small list of restaurants that a lot of folks like, but that I found unimpressive.  Glenn's Diner is on that list.  I've been there several times, and the thing I keep thinking as I'm eating there is... bland.  Maybe the owner or cooks have an aversion to using spices, but everything I've had there is been nothing to get too excited about.  Yes the fish, whether it was cod, trout or perch was well cooked.  But they all taste the same.  I will tell you the one thing I've had there that I've liked.... the chowder.  I've made chowder and have patted myself on the back a few times, (nice job with the red wine Johnny, you nailed it!), but their chowder was memorable.  The bacon stood out a bit more than is usual, and there was a lot of flavor packed in that bowl.  I've had that pretzel-encrusted fish dish they have... meh.  It was so bland I can't even remember which kind of fish it was.  This restaurant falls into my #2 category, I've had better everything at other restaurants (except for the chowder).  I'm sure I'll go there again this summer so I'll give them another try.
