I just went here today for lunch. I had been here once before, quite a while ago.  I must say it's great to sit outside here on a warm sunny day. . . I had a sandwich with romaine, avacado, smoked gouda, and mustard. It was pretty good, but not great. I wanted to indulge on one of their cupcakes but resisted the urge. . . The decor is clean and fresh. You order at the counter first and then wait at your table with a number for your food. So there is only minimal wait service--they bring your food and then bus it when you're done.. . Overall, it was okay to good, but not great. It's worth a try to form your own opinion.
