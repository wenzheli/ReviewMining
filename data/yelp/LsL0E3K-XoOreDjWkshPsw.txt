What happens when you have 3 Yelp Elites and a picky eater, and you're trying to figure out lunch?  Wilde apparently.  But don't let me get ahead of myself.. . The night before going to Wilde myself and another friend had discussed going to Furama for Dim Sum, so I awoke to that thought.  As it turns out, a third friend was arriving back in town via O'Hare, and a fourth was going to pick him up.  The fourth vetoed Furama, and the second got cold feet over it as well.  As the fourth and myself arrived at the airport, the third friend, hearing about my original desire for Furama said it sounded great, but it was a lost cause.  . . From that point on, various alliances were formed between members of our four person party in support of, or against restaurants including, but no limited to: Pauline's, Tweet, Stella's, Crisp, The Bagel, Perrys, and more.. . Of course, seeing as the day began at 9am with talk of brunch, sitting down to eat at 3PM was a bit of a stretch, but lest you think we went hungry all day, we actually took a break to get McDonalds in the middle of our debate!. . Somehow we ended up at Wilde, as I had had previous positive experiences, as had others.  I got the Shepherd's Pie and it was prepared perfectly, with plenty of delicious meats and veggies inside, with incredible mashed potatoes and Irish Cheddar on top.  The $3 well drinks were much needed due to the ridiculousness of the restaurant choosing quest, and were poured deep.. . Our server was incredibly accommodating considering our group's overall level of high maintenance (myself included), and her attitude truly made our experience all the better.  The only big knock on Wilde was the absurd music playing that brought the whole place down to a very morose mood.. . Will I go back?  Yes.  I just hope it's with a bit more of a plan next time!
