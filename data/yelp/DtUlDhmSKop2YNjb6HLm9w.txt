Menu is awesome and while some might argue not huge- spot on! Huevos Rancheros ROCK! The pancake of the weekend is usually pretty darn tasty too. This joint can get crowded at times, so keep that in mind, but if you go early enough and score a table, you're set for success! Cozy place with a mixture of everything which is reflective of the neighborhood itself.  I have never had a bad breakfast here- always delish- thanks for M &amp; H for making my mornings a bit sweeter - ok, corny I know, it's the advertising in me
