Restaurant: Uncommon Ground
Category: American (New)
Uncommon Ground is 2 blocks away from my bf's apartment and it's one of his favorite restaurants.  . Since I'm adamantly opposed to restaurants that can't stop talking about how organic they are...in fact I don't believe in eating Organic at all. I was surprised I actually liked Uncommon Ground.. However on a Sunday morning when most other restaurants around the neighborhood are either closed or only serving brunch (which I SUPER hate), I finally agreed to go back once again and give it another try.  . OMG...even if I hate healthy organic ingredients you just can't ignore how delicious all their items are.  Like the greedy little girl I am, I made my bf split it super juicy burger with me, while I ate way more than my 50% of the 3 cheese pizza.  . I take back all my negative thoughts and I'd definitely go back again and again!
