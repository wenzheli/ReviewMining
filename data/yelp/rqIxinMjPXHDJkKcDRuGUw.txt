Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
My version of the "happy" meal:. . #7: Shrimp and pork spring rolls. #40: Combination pho + extra tripe . #235: Lima + soda water + ice. . Completely lifted my spirits on a gray, rainy Saturday when I was probably going to punch someone if J hadn't taken me here to get my aromatherapy through beef broth on. What do they put in this stuff?! Calm restored upon biting into those soft rice paper rolls, anger worked out while tearing up basil leaves, and then coma induced after eating a ton of beef parts, noodles, and drinking every drop of that broth. This is true love.
