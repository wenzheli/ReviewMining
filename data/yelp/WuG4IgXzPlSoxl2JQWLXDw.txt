My friends and I went here for drinks after dinner and I was very impressed. The doorman greeted us at the door and he even escorted us to the stairs that led upstairs. The wait staff there was extremely friendly from the moment we sat down at the table overlooking the high rises around us. . . We ordered the ahi tuna tower, fondue, and some steak sliders. Wow, these were so good! Drinks were also great! I had the Mojito (best i've had in the city). Overall, the ambiance and drinking experience was awesome. I will definitely come back here for dinner.
