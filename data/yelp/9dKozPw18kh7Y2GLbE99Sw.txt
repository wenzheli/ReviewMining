It's hard to review a place that has so many reviews already.  It's intimidating, to say the least.  Why read my review?  Why not that of others?  Temptations says give it One star then the a great review, just to mix it up.  Common sense says don't be an ass.. . A Churrascaria is a Brazilian or Portuguese steakhouse.  Brazzaz is such a place.  The format is this:  You get your table and sit, and small noshes are brought to your table (Typically palette cutting items like bread, or fried bananas).  You  enjoy a well crafted soup, salad and small plate island before returning to your seat, and ordering one of their many vintages.  Then you flip a small plastic medallion over to its green side, and wait.  Before long, a handsome young man appears tableside holding a skewer of meat, one of many varieties that have been prepared for the meal.  At your discretion he slices off a portion and you accept it onto your plate, and he slides on to the next table.. . This is AWESOME.. . Being a meat lover, I can say the meat served is the best I've ever had.  Delicious, tender, flavour filled cuts of lamb, sirloin, filet, chicken...even roasted pineapple, sweet and sour and succulent.. . Brazzaz is always full, so shoot for a reservation.  I'd say it's an excellent place for a big date.  Not the first date, mind you, but maybe the third.. . Expect to take a taxi (Not worth parking), expect to spend a little (50 bucks a head, plus wine and tip), expect to enjoy yourself.  My advice would be to use this as a pre/endcap to a night out at the theatre or the like.  Enjoy yourself.
