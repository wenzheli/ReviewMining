Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
I've been here a couple of times, and I'll definitely keep going back.  Highlights: delicious beef noodle soup, fast service, good prices.  They also have great Vietnamese sandwiches, which my less adventurous-food-inclined other half can enjoy.  . I've also had the spring rolls and egg rolls, which are quite good.  Sadly, my preferred pho place back home has spring rolls with pork and shrimp, and this place only comes with shrimp--but shrimp is nothing to complain about.  Also, I love to wrap my eggrolls in lettuce, and Tank only gives one tiny piece of lettuce for every two rolls.  But the rolls were tasty!. I've also had the young coconut drink, which was literally a young coconut with its top hacked off and a straw in it.  Tasty, but I wish they'd excised the coconut flesh and put it in a glass--makes me feel less silly about having a $3 coconut when I could've gotten one for much less as the supermarket down the street.. Overall, quite delicious, and I will come again...and again...and again.
