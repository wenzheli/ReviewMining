My friend and ate here on a Sunday evening early, around 5pm. The place was already packed so we hovered around the bar until some bar stools were free and ended up eating at the bar. The food portions are enormous, I was expecting a meal 1/3 the size of the portion that I was served, and it is pretty cheap (especially if you take home leftovers and can get a second meal out of it). I had a tofu veggie dish in a light ginger sauce with rice. Delicious. The only negatives were the lack of available tables and it was kind of noisy.
