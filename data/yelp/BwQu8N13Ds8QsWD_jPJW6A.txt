I first went to this restaurant for my birthday with a group of friends, and we were all drooling over our plates.  Every dish had a unique flavor, and the plantains were the best.  I enjoyed the selection of drinks, including the frozen mojito.. . I also went back a few weeks later for brunch...and that blew me away even more than the dinner!  I had the crabcake benedict, and it was the best eggs benedict-style dish I've ever had!  And, that's my favorite brunch plate, so I've tried a lot of places.  They add just a hint of spice to the hollandaise sauce that makes it unbearably good.  My friend had something like stuffed waffles...heavenly!  Yeah, this place is amazing.
