Restaurant: Sapori Trattoria
Category: Italian
My first visit (and certainly not the last) to Sapori Trattoria happened to be New Years Eve and my birthday.  They really packed the restaurant and jacked up the prices, but despite all the people and bigger price tag, it still felt like that cozy, intimate Italian restaurant.  In no way did I feel it to be pretentious.  . I ordered the pumpkin ravioli and as a vegetarian, it's nice to have a pasta dish that feels substantial without being overly creamy.  It tasted really fresh, albeit a little oily.  . The staff was attentive and friendly, despite the restaurant being crammed with people.  Loved it!
