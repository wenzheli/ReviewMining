Meh.  Food was edible but based on the reviews I expected a lot more.  Had the gnocchi, for $18, it should have been ROCK STAR!  It's pasta!  I've made better at home.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't worth $18 not even for handmade pasta made with organics.  The portion was tiny and I don't eat a lot. . . My companions had the mac n cheese, buffalo steak, and meat loaf.  Mac n cheese was small too.  Meal loaf was def the winner.  . . Buffalo steak was slices and grilled a little salty but good.  The corncake was a little strange.  But the ENORMOUS  cheese stick we were not even sure what to do with.  It was like a huge crispy phallus laying on the plate. . . Drinks were strong.. . I have no issue spending money on food but felt that the food was way over priced for the quality and quantity. . . Might stop in for a drink if in the hood but otherwise won't be back.
