Restaurant: Glenn&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
If you want to get down, and not be teased by the menu, do not go on the week days. My first trip to Glens diner was good, but nothing noteworthy. This was because their weekday menu lacks most of the GREAT things they have to offer. Can't even get some good ol' biscuits and gravy on a thursday morning! c'mon!. . Well, this weekend things were different. I walked up the Glen's diner Sunday morning with the eye of the tiger. Victims this trip were the corned beef hash and eggs, and blue star crab cake benedict.  Corned beef comes out, and I'm like "what the, where's the eggs". They were hidden under REAL corn beef AND real diced potatoes. It was very good. Nothing mind blowing, but  the use of real fresh ingredients is ALWAYS a plus. I have actually never seen real chunks of corned beef used. woohoo! Add some hot sauce and pepper to kick it up a notch.. . Crab cake benedict was very good as well. When it came out, it looked kind of small, but I was barely able to finish it. Crab was fresh and flavorful, but they could be a bit more generous with the  hollandaise. . . I heard the mimosas are the booooomb, and they looked to be very good also. Key ingredient, triple sec. They come with your own personal bottle of bubbly too (very small, don't get excited). I opted to pass on the booze though. womp womp.. . Great place. lots to try, everything looked good. outdoor seating in a plus, maybe even a must.
