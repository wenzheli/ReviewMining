Restaurant: Icosium Kafé
Category: Creperies
Fresh ingredients, friendly service, reasonable prices.  Five stars!. . I did the "make your own crepe" option.  The server helped me decide what would go best together with the Icosium dressing.  I chose artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomato tapanade, and roasted peppers with brie.  DELICIOUS.  I moaned throughout the entire meal. . . The crepes also come with soup.  I chose the vegetarian soup.  It was pureed.  I don't like pureed soup because it reminds me of eating baby food.  But goo-goo-ga-ga, I loved it.  . . Some reviews say they've raised their prices.  I still think $9.99 is a fair price for a bowl of soup and a huge crepe filled with love.
