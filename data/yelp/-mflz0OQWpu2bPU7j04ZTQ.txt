This is a cute, clean, little Greek cafe.. . Would I go here for a true Greek dinner? No, I would go down the block to the old-time traditional restaurants here in Greektown.. . Perfect lunch place. You order your food cafeteria style. A waiter brings your food out to your table.. . Excellent Egg Lemon soup! Wonderful homemade all-U-can-eat Greek bread baskets. Very good Greek salads (and others). . Nice little bakery counter. Good customer service, friendly staff.
