What is it with this place? . . Everything on the menu is greasy. I ordered a bison burger and the plate arrived with a layer of grease on the bottom of the plate. The "special sauce" that was indiscriminately spread on the bun had no taste whatsoever.  . . Luxe Bar this isn't. The place has the look and feel of what  someone from Schaumburg thinks a Chicago neighborhood restaurant should  be.  Actually, this place would be perfectly located in Woodfield Mall, but it's sadly out of place in Lakeview.
