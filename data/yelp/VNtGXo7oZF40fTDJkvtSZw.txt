My boyfriend and I went to TRU to celebrate our one-year anniversary. We came in with very high expectations. I know the service would be exceptional, but I was a tad worried about the quality of the food. We had a 5:30 dinner reservation so we were one of the first patrons on a Saturday night. It was nice to walk into a spacious and very quiet dining room. It was actually a tad intimidating with the 10+ waitstaff standing around. ;). . When we made the reservation, we let them know that we would be celebrating our anniversary. They made the night very special with phenomenal service (the waiters really do synchronize their movements), personalized menus that we could take home, and a small dessert plate that read "Happy 1st Anniversary." I was really surprised by how much effort they put into making it a great evening.. . The food was good, but as mentioned already, portions are small. We had the three course prix-fixe dinner and ended up getting extra cheese and dessert courses. It's a little tricky when they roll out the cheese and dessert carts. We naively assumed that these goodies were part of our meals, but of course - they weren't! Our bill was pretty high, and I felt a tinge of guilt as my boyfriend forked over his credit card. I didn't get a glance at the check, but I'm pretty sure it was in the $500 range. . . Would I return? Probably not. But I had a memorable night. If anything the service overcompensated for the food. Plus the personalized menus now sitting on my coffee table will always remind me of the night my boyfriend really showed me what fine dining really was!
