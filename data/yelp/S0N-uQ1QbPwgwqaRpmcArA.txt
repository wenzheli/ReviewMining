I went here for dinner after running the CARA Lakefront 10-miler earlier in the day, so I definitely brought my appetite!  Our large party was seated in the spacious back room comfortably, and service was just fine- no complaints!  Food: I got the 2 taco plate with ground beef, rice and refried beans-- very tasty and satisfying!  The boyfriend got steak fajitas w/guacamole and also enjoyed them.  The best part? The flavored house margaritas!  I had  strawberry and raspberry flavors and they were deeelicious and fairly strong (bonus after my race...I slept like a baby that night)  Not super cheap, but food is good quality and tasty---I would love to go back for more margaritas!! :)
