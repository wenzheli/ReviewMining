Restaurant: Sapori Trattoria
Category: Italian
This is, hands down, my new favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago. My mom's co-worker has been recommending it for years, and I can't believe we didn't listen sooner! . . Everyone who worked there from the waitstaff to the host to the owner were incredibly and genuinely nice people. Our waiter said that Sapori Trattoria is still his favorite restaurant and that he'd been coming there for years before he worked there- what a nice compliment! . . Mom and I couldn't resist the combination of pumpkin ravioli and one of their specialty veal dishes. Every bite was mouthwatering! The lasagna got rave reviews from Mom's friend, so we actually asked our waiter if we could take an order home for my step-dad- no problem! I tried some the next day, and it was awesome!. . I will most definitely be bringing my family or a hot date or good friends back here as soon as I can!
