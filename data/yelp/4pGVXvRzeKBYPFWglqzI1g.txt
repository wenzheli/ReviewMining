Just tried Sushi-X, and I have to say I was underwhelmed.  The rolls I got, spicy scallop and the honey roll, were really dressed up.  Tons of mayos and random stuff.  Normally I like that in smaller degrees, but I also like to know that I'm actually eating raw fish.  I'm weird like that when I come to sushi.  The gomae, additionally, was just eh.  Would I say it's the worst I ever had?  No.  Best?  Not so much.  This was just delivery though, so I want to try the storefront before I make a final decision.  Anyone can have an off night.
