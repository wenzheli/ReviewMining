Restaurant: Icosium Kafé
Category: Creperies
My first impression wasn't too great since the service is pretty slow and the decorum seems a bit much, but then the food arrived.   It was like a work of art!  I love when a restaurant will go the extra mile for a great presentation and this place does it well.  The crepes were great - I've gone a few times now and tried both sweet and savory crepes and have yet to be disappointed.  A friend and I ordered the Turkish coffee on one visit and they brought out this beautiful coffee pot and some cute little cups for our table service.  Very nice!
