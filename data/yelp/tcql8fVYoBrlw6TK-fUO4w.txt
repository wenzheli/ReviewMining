Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s
Category: Pizza
I don't love pizza (or most italian-american food), but the gratuitous amount of cheese on Giordano's pizza makes me happy.. . Unfortunately, with so much cheese on the pizza, it's difficult to taste the toppings.. . Still, it's better than any deep dish I've had back home in Los Angeles.
