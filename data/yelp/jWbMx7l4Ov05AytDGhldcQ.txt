I'm a fan of Wilde for it's comfortable atmosphere, good appetizers, and varied beer selection. They have all the standard domestic beers with a good mix of imports and micro-brews, all for a reasonable price. They also have tasty appetizers like their mussels (I think those were a daily special) and their curry chips (so authentic). However, I've been disappointed by their entrees twice and this time it only took me two times to learn my lesson! I had their meatloaf (a nice hearty portion, but strangely sweet) a while back and, more recently, their burger. The burger patty was perfectly cylindrical, the hallmark of a frozen patty. It did come with the option of several good looking cheeses, bacon, etc, but like they say, you can put lipstick on a pig, but a frozen patty is still gross.
