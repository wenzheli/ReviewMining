Restaurant: Mayan Palace Mexican Cuisine
Category: Mexican
I liked Mayan Palace in my first visit.  The one thing that I was really impressed with, and that I wasn't expecting, was the level of service.  It was helpful, friendly, and attentive.  Some of the best I've had.  . . The margaritas were very good, and our dinner options were too.  I went with the chimichanga (I seems to always get these when I go for Mexican), and it was definitely tasty.  . . I'm still continuing my quest to try out all the different mexican restaurants around and decide which is my favorite, but Mayan Palace is in contention, and I'll go back again.
