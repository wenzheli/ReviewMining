So right off the back, make reservations. Especially for a Friday or Saturday night. . . Now for the food;. . Appetizer: Ceviche. It a pretty good and different from the way I'm used to having it. This one used a tomato and lime base and came pretty close to what I would call a seafood cocktail rather then ceviche. Again unique and different so it gets a thumbs up. Plus you have to love the nice serving  of avocado that comes with it. . . Entree - Ropa Vieja off the Cuban section. The meat was very flavor and succulent but it ultimately left something to be desired. Don't get me wrong I love Cuban food but it was missing something. Good portion of rice and black beans that bring you to the perfect point of being full. . . Drinks - Damn good Mojitos and so - so Margaritas. . Perks: Right off the Irving Park Brown line, TVs in the bar area and friendly staff.. . You can bet I'll be back again.
