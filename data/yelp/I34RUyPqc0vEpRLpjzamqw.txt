Yep, I'm wild about Wilde. Great location, cozy pub type atmosphere, good beers on tap and an extensive menu with traditional and new faves. What's not to like!. . On a Saturday night there was a 15 minute wait for our party of 4, but a quick beer with the friendly bartender and we were seated in a cozy booth towards the back. Writing this I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu items, but I can't recommend the mac &amp; cheese enough. Definitely up there as one of my new favorites - the side portion is plenty for a dinner entree. Gooey, bacon cheesiness is perfect for a cold night. I added the green beans with tomatoes and cheese bits as an additional side but it was a pretty large portion. Great fries. Spicy buffalo chicken sandwich. Too much food and not enough room for dessert but the menu looked good.. . Love it and can't wait to come back.
