Celebrated a friend's bday at the lounge.  Great open space and nice interior, but here's the problem.  I ordered a vanilla infused bourbon cocktail with muddled fruit.  It was way too tart and I didn't taste the bourbon.  I think there was just no balance because there was hardly any bourbon in it.  . . I'm sorry Zed451 but I'm gonna have to call you out on watering down your spirits.  . . So my friend ordered red bull vodka and tasted just red bull.  5 patron shots that tasted liked agave water.  And to confirm our suspicions, my friend ordered a shot of Grey Goose straight up and no surprise it was some damn expensive quality H2O.  . . There was a bar that I frequented in Scotland that had 1 pound well drinks that were watered down.  I can deal with that.  But it's just wrong to charge downtown Chicago prices for drinks in which the main ingredient can come from the bathroom sink.  I think this is a great place if you're the designated driver, in fact this is a great place to prevent kidney stones.. . I thought Zed was beautiful and had a great vibe, but it was missing something.  I just can't put my finger on it, oh... how about more ETOH and less H2O!
