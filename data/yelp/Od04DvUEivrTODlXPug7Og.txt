Ok I must admit I'm not a big fan of the run of the mill Chinese restaurant's.But my Buddie Lu told me that this is his favorite BBQ joint.. So we walk in and there you go the hanging duck and the regular type of set up you would expect.But of boy what a surprise My first item was Soft shell crab ..oh my god.. yummy. then Lu ordered #210  BBQ Pig Hong Kong Style. WOW amazing taste crunchy on the outside tender on the inside.And to follow up with a Wonton Noodle soup #45.It was nice to find a great BBQ spot that was a treat to eat.
