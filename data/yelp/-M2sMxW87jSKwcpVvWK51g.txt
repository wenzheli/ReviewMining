Restaurant: Calo Ristorante
Category: Pizza
I was expecting Calo to be sub-par compared to the many great Italian restaurants in Anersonville/Edgewater, but was surprised to find that it was very nice.  The crowd is older, dressed nicely.  I expected the menu to be pricey (based on the fancy dress), but was in the $13-$25 range per person (a lot of pasta dishes were around $14).  Full stocked bar.  Live Jazz Trio playing standards and Sinatra.  Fancy decor and low lighting.  The pizza bread that they give you before the meal is 5 star.  I had the vegetable lasagna, which was stuffed with ricotta and fresh spinach.  Yum.  I would recommend this place as a good date spot.
