Restaurant: Brazzaz
Category: Steakhouses
Started our restaurant week extravaganza off at Brazzaz. We went on a week night and got reservations for the same night we booked. Didn't have any of the waiting issues a few people seemed to, as we were seated right away, even though we were a bit early. . . Our waiter started off super nice and attentive, but kind of disappeared and never came back - not a huge deal, since the men with the meat were our main target! . . We ordered an overpriced bottle of wine (seriously, I google-ed it when I got home... 75% markup!) but it was a decent suggestion. . . The salad bar was amazing - but I was careful not to fill up on the healthy stuff... I was in the market for beef! Nice selection though, from capresse salad to mushroom risotto to sushi (sushi didn't look to hot though). . . The meat... ohh the meat. Every piece was my favorite piece. The chicken was not too bad, but nothing like the meat! . . You certainly couldn't eat like this all the time, but every once in awhile (and especially at the discounted price) this is a wonderful indulgence!
