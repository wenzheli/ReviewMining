Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s
Category: Pizza
My first Chicago deep dish pizza was Giordano's but I had it in Orlando FL.  I didn't like it.  It was too cheesy.  . . Now I live next to Giordano and the plan is to order take out there every month.  . . Spinach and mushroom is yummy but my fiance will not let me order it so we will be having sausage and onion. . . So what has changed since Orlando?  I don't know but Giordano in Chicago is good.
