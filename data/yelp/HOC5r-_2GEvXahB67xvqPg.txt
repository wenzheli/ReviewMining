If you can't tell from the rest of the reviews... the margarita deal (tues/thurs) is fairly awesome! Service is quick and everyone I spoke with was so nice.  Last time I was there we had a larger party but were still seated within minutes. Considering the packed house the restaurant hummed with happiness. On a nice night see if you can get a seat on the back patio, though the energy in the dining rooms is pretty great. My table had a good time watching soccer and snickering at the very young drinkers living it up at the table next to us.. . I split the nachos and quesadilla apps with a friend-- more than enough food. The nachos ended up feeding us for two days! I can be a bit of a guacamole snob and theirs was up to par. This isn't a mexican place to get creative mexican food, but they're not trying to be that place. If you like mexican, you'll like this.. . Take note- the 1/2 price margaritas applies to pitchers too!
