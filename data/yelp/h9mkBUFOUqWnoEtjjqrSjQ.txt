Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
I decided to stop in to The Pasta Bowl because of all the good things that I read about it here on Yelp. My lunch was better than I had even expected it would be! I tried the Farfalle Pollo (Bow Tie Chicken) and it was magnificent. I also had the best broccoli cheese soup that I've ever tasted! . . I really like how the place is set up, like a high class diner. You can watch the cooks work. There's something cool about knowing for sure that your meal didn't come from a microwave. I also had excellent service. I will be coming back to The Pasta Bowl a lot.
