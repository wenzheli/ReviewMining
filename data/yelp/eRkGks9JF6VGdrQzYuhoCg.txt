Hold up, give me a second........ . Now let's see:. -Gotta add these picked carrots and radishes to my bun. -Cannot forget these juicy pieces of duck and it's crispy skin. -Oh yeah, a drizzle of hosin sauce should do it. . CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP!. . Ok, now where was I? Oh yes, review on yelp. Hello you!... Yes, you the one staring at my review. This is probably a rendition of what you will encounter if you venture to Sun War Bar-B-Que and get the peking duck special.  Is it worth the $30 or more , yes I think so. I think the duck thinks so too!.... "Quack Quack". . The duck is succulent and moist and the skin is crispy without all the slathering oil.  At first glance, the 6 measly buns didn't seem to satay my hunger. But after eating 3 and the bf eating 3 I was good and happy. I couldn't forget I also had make a compartment in my stomach for the rice and soup that was about to come my way.  Rice and soup were good but nothing too fancy; the duck was the main attraction at this theme park!  . . Note: I rather the duck special to be served (1-2-3) style meaning (soup, rice, and duck) instead of (3-2-1) meaning (duck, rice, and then soup)... But if you think about it, it wouldn't make sense to make soup from the duck first and then hack up pieces for the rice and then have no meat from the duck to make your delicious buns!. . Forget it, I'll stick to 3-2-1 !
