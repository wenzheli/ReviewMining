Ooooooh, the crepe place.  . . I know that people usually go for sweet crepes, and don't get me wrong, they're really awesome here.  Nutella?  Chocolate?  Fresh whipped cream?  Yes, please  . . But the savory crepes are where it's at.  My favorite has munster cheese, avocados, roasted peppers, sun-dried tomoatoes, spinach, cilantro, and greens.  The flavors are just wonderful and really combine to give you something unique.  The crepes are a deal at around $7 each including soup.  . . While crowded on weekend mornings, it's not bad the rest of the time.  Definitely worth checking out for brunch or for a romantic dessert to share.
