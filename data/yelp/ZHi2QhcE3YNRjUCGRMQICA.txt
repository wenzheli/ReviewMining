After my 24 course mind-blowing experience at Alinea, I wrote Grant Achatz a thank you note.  For teaching me how to taste.  It was an unrivaled experience that I have yet to encounter at any other fine dining establishment, though the chef's table at Charlie Trotters was also absolutely incredible--if you have 5 hours about a about $225/person to play with, do whatever it takes to get a seat at Alinea.  . . The last time I ate there was a year or two ago and I still revel in the glory of that meal--the highlight of which came when a juniper infused pillow was placed before each diner, upon which the plate rested.  As the course continued, the juniper wafting from the pillow perfectly complimented the entree.  Genius.  . . A stunning meal without pretension.
