Restaurant: Icosium Kafé
Category: Creperies
The best way to experience Icosium Kafe is to go with a friend. Order one savory crepe and one dessert crepe. Split them in half and share. The crepes are a good portion and oh so yummy. You can either pick a pre-designed crepe or make one yourself, so the possibilities are endless. The service is a little iffy, sometimes it's great, sometimes it's not, so just make sure you're not in a hurry. Pretend you're in Europe and take a long leisurely meal at Icosium. Parking is a little crowded since it's in Andersonville, but the Clark Street Bus stops right in front.
