Restaurant: Greek Islands Restaurant
Category: Greek
Greek Islands gets 5 stars for the following reasons:. . 1) Consistency in service. There is not a waiter that is there that is not fabulous. they know how to take care of a table.. 2) Always being able to seat. I have only waited 10-15 minutes max for a table on one of the busiest days of the year. They always accomodate, and they are open fairly late!. 3) AWESOME FOOD. And great management. Very friendly.. . It is my second favorite restaurant in the city. Oh, if you like white wine, try a bottle of Petrulianos. It is a little sweet. light and excellent!
