Loved this place! My friend lives down the street and brought me here on Friday... Reasons it gets 5 stars:. . 1. We started the bar, as per her suggestion. Bartender was fabulous and willing to teach me all about the different sake types (I'm new to the whole sake thing and told him that). He let me try a little of everything, explained it to me, etc... And when we asked for our tab... He said it was on the house because he enjoys teaching people about sake. Needless to say he got a great tip, for being helpful, and nice :). . 2. We sat outside on a nice night and ordered California Rolls and the Salad Rolls. Both were really good. . . 3. A table was ready for us when we got there... but we sat at the bar for probably a good hour, maybe longer .We got some roll recommendations from the bartender as well as a "frequenter" who was sitting at the bar. He knew the whole menu and was really helpful.. . 4. When we were ready to leave the bar, we were still able to sit outside whenever we were ready.. .There really wasn't any rush for a table and we were able to enjoy our sake lessons beforehand.. . 5. The ambience - the bar is great. Not too loud, cozy, comfortable, and friendly. The outside patio is nice as well... I haven't eaten inside yet so I can't speak for that.. . All in all - a great experience. Really glad I tried it out and recommend it :)
