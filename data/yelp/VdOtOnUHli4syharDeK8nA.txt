I was really excited to go here.  My sister and her boyfriend are in love with this place.  Myself, i cant say no to empanadas or papa rellanas.  There are quite a few Cuban and Hispanic restaurants in Florida, and I have to say they are ALL better than this place.  The beef in the papa rellanas (it's a ball of mashed potato with meat in the middle then deep fried) was watery and had a sour flavor.  The empanada was perfectly bland.  It was a really cute place though.  oh and IRON BEER!  mmm.
