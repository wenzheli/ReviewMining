we drive by this place all the time and i'm always bugging my bf to take me here.  finally, after weeks of nagging he brings me here last weekend. . now, i'm a huge fan of the jibarrito at borinquen so i was pleasantly surprised that they had something similar but called guarito.. the guarito has marinated steak, lettuce, tomato and swiss cheese all on a flattened, fried plantain.  the only difference is that there is no mayo on the guarito.  also, they use american cheese instead of swiss on the jibarrito.  but all in all, i would say that their guarito was just as good as the jibarrito.. . the mister ordered the lechon sandwich and it was just alright.  the lechon's seasoning was a bit bland  and he didn't seem so crazy about it so i don't think he's going to order that again.. we also ordered 2 meat empanadas and they were delicious.  i especially love the dressing they give you with your order.  we'll definitely be back to try other things on the menu.
