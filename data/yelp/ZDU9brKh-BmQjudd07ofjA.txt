So we all get it.  It's anywhere from great to phenomenal.  In the last ten years I've been going here, I've had one bad experience.  They sat me and my friend underneath their neon 'Open" sign and there were bugs everywhere.  So what did you guys do?  Promptly comp half of our meal.  Seriously, the lack of flair and any other BS makes the food and the service at PB the best.  Also, they must have an oversupply of their house wine because it always comes nearly topped off all the time.  . . Obviously try the farfalle, ravioli and conchiglie.  Monday night lasagna is delicious, a bit pricy, I think, though.  Since I'm doing the anti-Atkins, they're always good about bringing me more bread and butter.  . . One of the few legitimate reasons to venture in to the LP.
