Restaurant: Milk &amp; Honey Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Milk &amp; Honey Cafe in Wicker Park has a bit of a Brooklyn feel to it - you must wait your turn and then sit thisclose to hip, young people while enjoying delicious coffee and slightly eclectic dishes.  Friends and I ventured out  on a Saturday morning for their famed Huevos Rancheros, decidedly their most well-known dish. We waited in a line inside the cafe for nearly 20 minutes, but it gave us time to deliberate our order and drool over the dishes that came out from their open kitchen. The hostess was very patient, but the "please stand in single file" line was a bit testing after the tenth reminder. Decor was modern; Le Klint pendants contrasted nicely with exposed brick and hardwood floors.. . When we were finally seated, our lattes came out relatively quickly. I had the chai latte, perfectly sweetened and balanced with creamy frothy whole milk. Milk &amp; Honey cafe served their own house blend of coffee created by Intelligentsia; slightly burned and would be better served hand-pressed. . . The Huevos Rancheros were hearty, and had a stick-to-your-ribs goodness while remaining delicately spicy. Orange Brioche French Toast was eggy, buttery, and fluffy; their house special orange poppyseed pancakes were also very fluffy. Overall the dishes were well done and delicious; even the garnishes were tasty. The little scoops of butter were extra creamy. Syrup was not overly sweet and served in a glass oil dispenser. . . We left Milk &amp; Honey cafe thoroughly satisfied. :)
