Restaurant: Mayan Palace Mexican Cuisine
Category: Mexican
Mayan Palace is the perfect restaurant (for me) because it's simple, it's consistent and it's awesome.  It's not high-heels, it's flip flops; it's not a fancy dress, it's jeans and a t shirt; it's not full makeup, it's mascara and chapstick.. . My favorite things about Mayan Palace are the following:          . . 1)  promptly refilled chips and salsa;. 2)  promptly refilled water / pop / iced tea;. 3)  delicious guacamole;. 4)  delicious chicken burritos;. 5)  delicious and strong margaritas in many flavors;. 6)  friendly staff;. 7)  they don't rush you even when it gets crowded;. 8)  even when it's crowded I've never waited more than 5 minutes (if at all) for a table;. 9)  it's very affordable; and. 10)  It is in walking distance from my apartment.
