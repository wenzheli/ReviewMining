I'm not a sushi eater. I've tried. The rolls get about an inch away from my mouth and the ocean fumes just kill it for me. And the seaweed reminds me of fish scales and the whole thing just turns into an ugly mess. So while my more palatably adventurous friends gorge on infinite rolls, I order Teriyaki. . . The miso soup and small salad don't deviate from the usual recipe, but the Teriyaki, in this case Steak, comes in seering pan much like fajitas arrive at a sit-down Mexican restaurant, except Teriyaki sauce creates a huge plume of brown smoke accompanied by an odor you're not quite sure smells good or bad. . . At any rate, the meat drowned in a really thick teriyaki glaze and the worst part of the entree rendered it not coming with anything short of a garnish. Most other places will give you some rabbit food on the side at the very least, but all I had in front of me were tiny steak pieces swimming in glaze on a searing hot plate that reminded me more of Cesar's fajitas than a sushi restaurant. . . Wakamono's redeeming qualities include its restroom and highly attentive staff. My friends will attest that the sushi is top-notch.
