The actual dining space is beautiful! It is very contemporary without feeling cold. It is a large space but surprisingly warm. The concept of this restaurant is designed like a Brazilian Steakhouse....the only difference that it is not Brazilian. It is a seasonal restaurant so the flavors change 4x a year to best reflect the seasons. . . The food is very good quality - better than most Brazilian Steakhouses I've been. Their harvest station is very unique and fresh. All the cuts of meat are cooked to perfect medium rare temp. They even serve fish and veggies to the table so it's not all meat. One of the best features are their seasonal cocktails! You must try and winter sangria - it had cinnamon in it and was to die for. . . The service was exceptional as well. All the chefs that come to the tables displaying their creations explained exactly what the meat was seasoned with and you were able to ask questions etc.... . . Wonderful experience - great price - fantastic environment.... . Just make sure to bring your appetite - I was full for days afterwards
