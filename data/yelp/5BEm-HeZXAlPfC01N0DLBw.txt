Solid Mexican food.  Affordable.  Great frosty drinks.   Super friendly and polite and quick waitstaff.  My only complaint is that we went here thinking their outdoor space really meant outdoors....instead you have to walk through a scary narrow gangway to a completely tented and covered (fully in the shade) area out back, that didn't make me feel like I was outside at all.  If they would just take that darn tarp off and lemme sit in the sun I would sip pina coladas there every Sunday.  I suppose if you are pale, concerned with skin cancer, or generally hate eating outdoors but want to feel a *little* outdoorsy then this is the perfect place for you.  Other than that, my burrito was scrum-diddly-umptious and I shall return for the food!
