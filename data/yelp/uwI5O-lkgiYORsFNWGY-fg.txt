Restaurant: Greek Islands Restaurant
Category: Greek
THE Greek restaurant in Chicago. Beuatiful inside with white tablecloths and traditional Greek decor. Attentive, knowledgable service. Amazing, mouth watering Greek fare just a short walk from the loop. The best part-the prices. Everything is very reasonable for the quality and amount of food. Great place for a date; beautiful setting, great food, and easy on the wallet!. . -------------------------. . Updated on 08/06/07. . I went back to Greek Islands after not being there for over a year and while I enjoyed myself, it was not up to the standard I was used to. The calamari was doughy and lacked flavor, beyond the batter. The chicken was bland, not as good as the chicken they have had in the past, and not as good as the chicken at neighboring restaurants. The service was rushed, and I was there early in the evening. Not bad, but it loses a star until they redeem themselves.
