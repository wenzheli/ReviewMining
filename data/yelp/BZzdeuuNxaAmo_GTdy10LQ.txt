Loukoumades! Loukoumades! Loukoumades! For $4.95 they'll bring you a large plate full of them, smothered in honey, and topped with cinnamon and walnuts. They were fresh, doughy, light and warm. Probably the best I've had. For dinner, the chicken spinach lasagna was also excellent. It came with tons of cheese on top, which I always appreciate.
