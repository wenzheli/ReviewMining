Restaurant: Alinea
Category: American (New)
So much has been written about Alinea.  The restaurant is an extraordinary experience, yet I can't give it 5 stars.  I waited a couple of weeks before writing because I wanted to be sure of my impressions.  Fyi - we had the twelve-course meal.. . What I didn't like so much:  fishy-greasy smell when we walked in.  And overall, several preparations were too salty for my taste.  I was ready to love everything.  But as the evening progressed, I didn't have that blissful "yum - bring it on" feeling.  There were too many fried onion slivers as well.  And one dish had a melted butter ball in a clear wrapper - like one of those bath beads you drop in the tub to dissolve -- except this one came with a warning to puncture it carefully so as to not be sprayed with hot butter.  Hmm, dangerous food; interesting.. . What I liked:  attentive service; comfy chairs (important because you want to spend hours enjoying the meal).  The freedom of not looking at a menu - letting the chef decide what to serve.  Amazing creativity in both food and serving pieces.  Beautiful presentations (the people at the table next to us were snapping photos).  A wine pairing that complemented the food and let us try interesting varietals and vintages.. . Considering the complexity of the food, it's too bad that saltiness stands out for me.  Although there was a new dish based on rhubarb that was gloriously pinky-red and fun (I skipped the onions)..   . The dishes were beautiful works of modern art.  So I'm wondering--is it possible to be so complex that something gets lost?  Like using all the colors in the palette and ending up with gray?  I'm glad I went to Alinea.  I'll always remember the unique presentations and the fun evening with my family.  If I'm looking for purely delicious though, I'll choose Tru or Trotters.
