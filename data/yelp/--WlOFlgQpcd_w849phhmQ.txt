Restaurant: Cafe 28
Category: Cuban
I lucked out and work right across the street from my favorite cuisine.  I have only been to cafe 28 once, but it was really good.  I ordered the bistec a la cubana to share and I'm glad I did.  The portion was so big...4 meals worth.  . . Their maduras (sweet plaintains) were great.  As were the rice/beans and steak... so yummy.  . . However, I was dissapointed in the Tostones.  I love tostones... my Puerto Rican friend got me hooked.  I make them myself from time to time, but they are messy and difficult.  I thought this would be my new easy way out.  But they were very rubbery and not salted. I am convinced that I just got a bad batch.  I am going back soon and will order them again.  Until then 3 stars....
