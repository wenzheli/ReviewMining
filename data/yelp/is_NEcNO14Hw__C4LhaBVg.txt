Restaurant: Calo Ristorante
Category: Pizza
Yum. Their lasagna was delicious.  I actually haven't found good restaurant lasagna but the one at Calo is gooood!. I also tried their calamari fritti which was a disaster.  It was too tough and chewy and not good at all.  I liked their cocktail sauce that they paired it up with though, unique idea instead of the usual marinara.. Their Calo Special thin crust pizza was yummy.  I loved the nice chunks of italian sausage on there and the veggie balanced well.  It wasn't too much or too little of each ingredient.  The cheese is a little thicker than I'm used to though but I loved the crust.  It wasn't soggy or too bready.  It was just right.. The place itself was really clean, I wonder when it was built.  It all looks quite new too.  The service was nice but I had to wait about 20 mins longer than they said they'd take to get my carry-out order which was a bummer.. Oh yes and there's a free parking lot across (diagonally) the street from the restaurant.
