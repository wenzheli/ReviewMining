Fogo de Chao was leading the pack as far as churrascarias go...until Zed 451. . . First and foremost, it passes Nikki's anti-pretentious test. From the moment we walked in and were greeted/seated by the host, our time at Zed451 was on the up. Our waiter, as well as the chef's offering their tasties were both charming and accomodating. . . Of course, another highlight of the place is the decor with it's fireplaces and lounge areas. I'm sure the rooftop was one of the hotspots in the summer, and the onset of our crappy weather is a good excuse to indulge in the bar are with the fireplace.. . Warm earthtones are easy on the eye as well as the clean lines of the furnishings. I could say the place had an elegance to it--despite having the harvest bar. I'll think of it as a buffet for the bourgoise. It was defintely a step up.. . The food? Absolutely marvelous. The harvest bar was enough to do by itself with everything from pastas and salads to cheeses and veggies. I was particularly strung out on the black truffle butter. Buttery love it 'twas! . . When it came time to display my stone (ie, bring on the meat). to the scurrying chefs, it was a consistent flow of 'yes, please!' or 'absolutely!'  Everything was splendid, especially that buttery yum ribeye and the ahi tuna. It's been a minute since I've had food that tasted so good. . . We finished off the meal with a platter of dark chocolate goodies; everything from cake to cookies. So rich, it was sinful! Needless to say, at three in the morning I was wired and wide awake on a caffeine high!. . To say the least, one is in for a great dining experience at Zed451. They've got the magic combo: great service, great food and alluring ambiance.
