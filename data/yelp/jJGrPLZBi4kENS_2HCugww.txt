Okay, darlings, first rule of dining out in the city: if you go anywhere in the loop, you will most likely have to wait. So, please, for the love of God, if you decide to do this, do not bitch about the consequences. . . Yes, there is often a wait, generally on the weekends; however, this place is very close to my apartment and I go quite frequently. I've had to wait maybe three times for a table. You need to be wise about when you go, honestly. We often go on weekdays toward the end of the brunch times (but be careful, they close at 3). . . One of my favorite meals on the planet is Eggs Benedict. Yolk does them fantastically. I love the fruit I get on the side; even in the dead of winter it stays fairly fresh. My fiance always gets the corned beef hash, and I often steal bites from it. My brother enjoys Diabetic comas, so he gets the cinnamon bun french toast and a large O.J.  I had the BLT the last time I was there, and it was also pretty good. . . All in all, yeah, there are often waiters who look like they leave directly from the restaurant to go to their classes at Columbia. This is part of the charm of the South Loop, as I also know several Columbia students I don't mind (my fiance is one of them). I've only had one less than stellar sever at Yolk, and she wasn't terrible, more a bit flippant. . . All in all, I enjoy Yolk. Their ingredients are often fresh and the portions are large. Give it a chance. Just remember that you're traveling to a restaurant which closes at 3 (one of the main downfalls of breakfast joints) and is in the Loop -- not the burbs.
