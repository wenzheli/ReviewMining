I've had the opportunity to have other omelets since my recent one at Icosium Kafe, but chose otherwise so as to preserve the memory of The Best Omelet I've Ever Had.  . . The Best Omelet I've Ever Had was a custom combination of baby spinach, portabella mushroom, cucumber and goat cheese.  That would be four fixin's for those keeping score, and I didn't even exhaust the options.  Truthfully, I like a simple spinach omelet - it expanded my horizons to even add cheese - and it wouldn't have occurred to me to add cucumber if it weren't on the menu.  The result was a little like Seinfeld - an ensemble piece where each distinct element added to the whole.  . . Clearly, cucumbers = Kramer.. . Besides TBOIEH, the other item of note was the dessert crepe I shared.  I had fond memories of a banana and Nutella crepe I once had in California, but we opted for the Labella.  The banana/chocolate/almond/coconut combination was very good, but next time I will probably keep it simpler in order to maximize the impact of ingredients.  I just felt so rewarded after branching out with TBOIEH, but live and learn.    . . Otherwise, service and atmosphere are both solid.  Our waitress was friendly, and there are numerous Algerian/Turkish furnishings throughout.  It feels cozy, and the booths are perfect for people-watching.    . . I'll be back, and it will be soon.
