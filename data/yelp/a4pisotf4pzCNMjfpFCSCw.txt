Category: Breakfast & Brunch
it's a short walk from my house and i enjoy the coffee and food options... but after just a few experiences at this joint, i think i'm over it. the wait to get inside paired with the rude cashier and the overwhelming amount of baby strollers overpowered my experience. chicago brunch is too good to waste on so-so places.
