Category: Pizza
This place stands out for its great hospitality.  It is unfortunate that you can't get reservations for Spacca on the weekends.  The line gets long and the wait can be over an hour if you show up on a Friday or Saturday night.  Spacca is a bit of a hidden gem and this can be a problem because there is nothing nearby if you find the wait too long to bear.  The wait is certainly worth it, though.  And they are kind enough to bring free focaccia tastes for all while you wait.  I've even been treated to marinated onions and other appetizers.  They promise to make the wait bearable and will bring wine upon request.. . If you make it through the wait, the pizza is fantastic.  Truly a Neapolitan experience with both white and red thin crust pizza.  My favorite is the 4 cheese pizza.  The Prosciutto Rucola and the sausage they use are awesome as well.  Just be sure to order the pizza crispy if you get one with buffalo mozzarella, they get a little wet.. . A unique experience, with great service and the food is awesome.  I highly recommend making the trip.
