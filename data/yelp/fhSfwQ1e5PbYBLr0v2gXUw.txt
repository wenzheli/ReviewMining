Restaurant: Uncommon Ground
Category: American (New)
We went to uncommon ground for the first time today after hearing great recommendations from our friends. We were very pleased with the meal and ambiance. For some reason, I had the (mistaken) belief that Uncommon Ground was going to be kind of hippy. This was definitely not the case. It was actually a lot more upscale than I had imagined (as I noticed when I showed up in flip flops for dinner). Our table had an appetizer of yam fries (delicious) and then we had entrees of halibut, trout, pork and gorgonzola gnocci. All were very delicious. Great flavors in all dishes (gnocci was amazing but rich). Only complaint was the fish was slightly overcooked. The atmosphere was really nice - a series of connected rooms to make the large space feel smaller. I would definitely return. Entrees ran in the $17-$24 range with burgers/sandwiches less expensive.
