Wilde is having an identity crisis. I went tonight with a client and had blackened tuna with Japanese cold noodles.  Can someone please tell me how that is Irish?  It was tasty though.. . I have been here a number of times and I must say my favorite was at brunch.  I had a bowl of strawberries and bananas with fresh cream. WOW! That was so good.  Then the breakfast burger with egg on it and curry fries on the side.. . The service is hit or miss.  Tonight I had to ask the hostess to stop texting on her cell phone and show me to my table.  Unacceptable.
