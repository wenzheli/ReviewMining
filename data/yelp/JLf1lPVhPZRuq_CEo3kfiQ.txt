Free lunch? Yeah!! Our office had ordered pizza from here today. Wasn't exactly piping hot from the oven but damn, it was good. I tried both the thick and the thin crust pizzas.The spinach thick crust was ok but the thin crust was really really good.Had the veggie thin crust and the plain cheese, both were awesome. In comparison to Unos, I really liked Unos thick crust much better.Could only imagine how pizza would taste hot from the oven... probably 10 times better!
