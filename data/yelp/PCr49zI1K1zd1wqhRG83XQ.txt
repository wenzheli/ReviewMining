If you have never been to a Brazzilian Steak House I would go to Fogo De Chao. If you have been to Fogo, and  want to go back but can't aford the hefty price tag, then I would visit Brazzaz for the 19.99 lunch special.  It is a great value for the amout and quality of food you recieve.  The salad bar was smaller that Fogo's but they also offer pastas which was a nice change for the Vegan in our group.   I had a wonderful meal there and the decor was lovely but I must admit I was blown away by Fogo's service, quality of meats and gigantic salad bar (the smoked salmon is out of this world). . . If you can afford Brazzaz's $50 per person dinner... walk up a couple of blocks to Fogo De Chao and spend the extra $10-15. It's worth it.
