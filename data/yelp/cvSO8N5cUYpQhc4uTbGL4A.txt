Restaurant: Calo Ristorante
Category: Pizza
Your meal begins with most perfect focaccia bread, all entrees come with a soup and salad (when did restaurants stop doing this??) and they have a Tuesday rib special that's tough to beat.  Not to go un-noted, Calo also manages to have fountain Coca-Cola that is the best I've ever had.  All pasta dishes are plentiful and rich.  I highly recommend the lobster and ricotta stuffed ravioli.  When dining in, I prefer sitting at the one of the bar high tops.  Otherwise I enjoy good old-fashioned delivery until 1:30am on weekends - beats a burrito.
