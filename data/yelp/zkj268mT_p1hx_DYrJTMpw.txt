Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
Tank noodle is situated on the corner of Broadway and Argyle. Its wide windows, bring in a pleasant natural lighting to the room that only a sunny day can provide. The name Tank Noodles, is a nod to people who are looking for a light-hearted atmosphere, and perhaps a distant taste of Vietnamese home cooking. What gives Tank its appeal, is the activity of the restaurant. Lunch hour is packed with people from all kinds of places. The restaurant follows a chaotic rhythm, packed with people from all different parts of the city. This is what gives Tank Noodles its special character and why its business is thriving. In the end the food is still like most places around Argyle, average and highly formula-tasting. This is sad considering the environment of a restaurant should also match its food. Definitely a great place to bring a group of friends for the appearances.
