All my friends love this place...I'm not sold.  I've had a few of the sandwiches- not bad, but not the best--the beet salad was awesome.  An umbrella blew over and knocked me in the nose, tossed off my sunglasses and hurt like hell... I went in to tell them- because the other umbrella's were swaying like crazy--and they gave me a cookie- which was nice.  I went back again, the umbrellas were weighed down and the food was fine.  My friend's egg sandwich looked really good- my BLT was ok, guess it depends on what you order.
