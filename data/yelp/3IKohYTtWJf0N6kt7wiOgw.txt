Best breakfast in the city, in my opinion, and damn cheap too. (Most meals come with a free side of pancakes! Pancakes would run you $10 anywhere else in this city!) We've been here at least a dozen times and have never had anything less than amazing service, and the food comes out lightning fast too. The only downside would be the wait if you get there at a prime time, but that only shows how much people love this place.. . 5 stars. No-brainer.
