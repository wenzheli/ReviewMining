This has always been my favorite restaurant in Greek Town.  The environment is perfect with a Greek village theme, the accents and even a steep GREEK HILL which tables climb their way up.  My favorite table is at the top, except taking a bathroom break can be a hassle, yet a good way to work off their delicious burning Saganaki cheese.  I love their weekly specials and their pastichio and mousaka "lasagna" and the lemony Lake Superior White Fish.  If you're less experimental, the 1/2 broiled chicken is very moist.  All their dishes come with great carb sides of rice and potatoes!  If you have a big Greek family, as in the movie My Big, Fat, Greek Wedding (ah what a great flick!), then do the family style dinners for a good deal.. . A few downfalls would be:. -The wait that often may require you to wait a half an hour or more.. -Stern/serious (not necessarily rude) waiters is not uncommon, perhaps it's cultural.. -Recently, I guess they were shut down for a few days due to health inspection findings.  Hmmm now it's still busy as heck so something changed.  This won't lose me as a customer!. As with all the Greek restaurants, free valet parking is a plus (well it's not truly free since you have to tip).
