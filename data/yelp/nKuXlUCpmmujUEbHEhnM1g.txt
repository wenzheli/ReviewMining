Restaurant: La Pasadita
Category: Mexican
This place has real mexican food.  The tacos are not "white boy" tacos as some places have.  They make the tacos with meat, onions, and cilantro.  I've never gotten past the tacos cause I always crave them.  So I have yet to try anything else.  However, I've been told that this is the only one of the three that has the black salsa, which I LOVE.  So, if you like that salsa don't try the other ones, cause you can't get it there.  . . Also, if you eat in there is a waitress that will take your order.  She'll also bring chips and salsa (and by request pico de gallo).  There is a small private lot that is north of the first Pasadita that customers can park in.  But, generally there's parking on the street.  . . If you're craving mexican food skip Taco Bell and head to La Pasadita.  You can't go wrong with anything you order here, I've never heard anyone I'm with complain about their food.
