Restaurant: Yolk
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I love this place for a few reasons.. . 1) It's huge so even when there is a gigantic crowd (which there usually is), you get seated pretty quickly.. . 2) There is something for everyone.  Whether you want breakfast, brunch, lunch, etc....you can find it.  And ALL varieties of food.. . 3) I live in the South Loop where there isn't much and this is easily walkable/accessible from there.. . Anyway, the omelette's are good, pancakes are delish, etc.  If you want brunch, DEFINITELY try Yolk first!
