I dove into a culinary love affair of duck confit eggs benedict for brunch, with a nice cold beer, while the lovely blond across the table from me happily inhaled a BLT to shame all other BLTs, and with a first-rate glass of wine.. . Did you hear that first part?  Duck confit eggs benedict!  With spinach!. . What the hell else needs to be said?  . . OK, a few other points:  Our server was perky and polite, but didn't hover.  The bartender (ok, we hung around for post-brunch adult beverages) knew her way around a wine list quite nicely, and they have ample parking.   . . As a side note, we began to notice lots and lots of families with young children walking in the door.  While our concerns quietly mounted, we oddly heard no over the top toddlers screaming nor overly gushing mommies and daddies convinced they are the first in history to reproduce.  It seems there was a singer of children's songs on the stage in the back room.  It was clearly a riot for the parents and their children, while those of us talking sailor talk in the bar couldn't hear a peep of it!. . I'm going back for the cold bacon wrapped meatloaf sandwich.  See you there!
