Horrific Experience.  First time there but we were with a couple who are regulars to this place.  There were nine of us.  Three of us ordered the all you can eat crab legs.  When we were finished I had two legs left on my plate, I asked to take them home and they said NO!  OK., I guess some people might take advantage of the all you can eat...  Rather than have them go to waste, I spent 10 minutes getting the meat out of these legs.  When I was done I passed the plate to one of my friends to try.  OMG, the female (waitress, manager, Hitler)  RAN over to my friend and grabbed the plate away from him and said "NO SHARING".  It was so humiliating.   All nine people at the table had ordered and eaten an entree.  We weren't trying to get away with anything.  They would rather toss an entire plate of crab meat than let someone else at the table eat it.  I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT IN GLENN'S DINER AGAIN.   This was the rudest behavior I've ever experienced at a restaurant.  Come on Lady, apply a little common sense.  Because of your rudeness, you lost customers and they have nothing nice to say about their experience.  That's just bad business.  Probably the same lady that Jenny z. is talking about.
