Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
I've only been here once, but I was thoroughly impressed, and will gladly go back!  I stopped by with my fiance and his parents after he had just moved into a new apt in the city, and we decided to try The Pasta Bowl simply because we were tired, and it was right next door;  Good choice!  Everyone enjoyed their meal, and we shared desserts at the end... my chocolate mousse cake was divine!
