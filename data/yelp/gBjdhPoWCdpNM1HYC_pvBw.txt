What a great neighborhood byob!  The staff is excellent and ready to please.  The menu is very extensive with a wide variety of appetizers that go with the sushi/maki options and some that go with the thai options.  You can mix and match to get variety.  We had the Crazy Chicago roll.  Lots of veggies and a mixture of fish. Excellent.  For an entree, I got some Thai noodles.  The vegetables were very fresh and the sauce was light and not too over powering.  The dish was listed as hot but only had one hot pepper so didn't qualify as such in my book.  For dessert, I had the muchi ice cream.  An unusual, rice covered ice cream.  Again, it was delish like the rest of the meal.The bill came and I was in shock at how low the total was for two people for such a good and filling meal.   Indie is a great place for a date and still casual enough for friend to hang out for an affordable dinner.  Hands down going here again to try some of the other items on the menu.
