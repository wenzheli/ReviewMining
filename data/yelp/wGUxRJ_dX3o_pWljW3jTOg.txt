Thank heavens, no seating disasters like last time.  For two people on a Wednesday at 7:30, I just wasn't sure what to expect.  We had to take sushi-bar seats, but were seated right away and the host (different guy than last time) was downright polite.. . The food was still excellent.  We started with a tasty, tangy seaweed salad.  I ordered the Emerald roll again, along with the yellowtail-scallion and the Spicy Tako.  The latter is made with octopus and was perfect.  The other two were not as awesome as I remembered the last time, but still very, very good.. . We finished up with one more roll, the Kani Chung.  I don't remember what was on that one, but it was just as phenomenal as the Spicy Tako.  . . It was nice to see that one can have great sushi AND a pleasant dining experience at Wakamono.  Their stuff is probably the best that I've had in the city, so I'm going to have to start considering them my favorite.
