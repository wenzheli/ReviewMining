Restaurant: Wakamono
Category: Sushi Bars
"So Sorry", your restaurant was the worst experience EVER.. . Went to Wakamono for dinner with 6 friends.  We got seated right away and thought it would be great.  We had our BYOB (w/$6 corkage fee) wines opened and ordered.  The rolls came out pretty fast &amp; was standard Lakeview sushi, nothing special.  Now us girls aren't shy or slow about eating, so we finished our order relatively quickly and asked our waitress to have our other wine opened.  This is when it went down hill...fast!. . "So sorry, you can only have wine with your meal" - um, OK, then we'll order more.  (she disappears for a while, assuming she's opening our wine).  Then the owner comes to our table and tells us they can't open the wine, to which we reply we'll order more food.  . . "What do you want?" he asks.  . . We order another sushi roll and dessert.  He says "No, that's not enough for a meal."  Oh, really?. . And that's when it got real bad...you don't put anything between our group and more wine.. .  "This is not a bar." he says.  "Um, yeah, we just ordered $100 of your sushi and are planning to order more." This back and forth continued for a while and  it was just UNBELIEVABLE how rude he was.. . We could have understood the situation if;. 1) They would have explained their wine policy up front (and we could have spread out our order)  . . 2) We had been taking up a table with other people waiting.  However, NO ONE WAS WAITNG AND WE HAD ONLY BEEN SITTING FOR 45 MINUTES!!!!  . . There are SO many sushi places in Lakeview, and we will never EVER go back here.
