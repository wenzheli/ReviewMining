I guess you can't judge a book bye its cover.  If you see the sign above the restaurant, you'd think this was one of the 1000's of  generic quick serve burrito joints.  I can't imagine this sign has been updated since the 70's.  But it is indeed a nice little dark lit, sitdown and relax type of restaurant.  I absolutely agree with most and say the service is excellent.  Very friendly and attentive staff.  The menu also has a pretty good variety of food.  I was thoroughly impressed with the food,  just maybe a little disappointed that the mole was a little bland for me.  The chips were pretty average, not served very warm as I would have expected.  Overall though, definitely up there as far as Mexican food in the city goes.
