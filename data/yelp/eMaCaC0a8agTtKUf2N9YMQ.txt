PICKLES!!  PICKLES!!! MORE PICKLES!!!! GOD I LOVE THEIR PICKLES!!!  I love them so much I bought 2 dozen to take home and delight myself with giggles at home.  mmmmmmmmm.. . Best B.L.T. I have had in a long time. Did I mention the PICKLES are the best thing in the world ?  They must be covered in drugs. I want more.. . If I had to nit-pick anything, it would be the slight wait at the door -- no worries though, it is worth the wait!!. . mmm, pickles.
