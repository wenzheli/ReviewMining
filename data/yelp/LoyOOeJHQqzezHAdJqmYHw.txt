Stumbled across this place last night...had never heard of it. Was SO glad we took the chance and checked it out. The place was hopping and had a nice, casual atmosphere. The service was very attentive and the food was delicious. They had a huge list of fish specials on a blackboard in addition to the regular menu. In fact, I barely even looked at the menu. Long enough to read the breakfast menu and am def. looking forward to going back and trying it out.
