In short: don't waste your money. Go to Fogo'a instead. I was taken here by family. The place itself is impressive. Nicely decorated Zen like waiting area paired with hip music and the tables are nicely decorated, dark with candles and fireplaces. . . We were greeted by an amuse bouche of scallop cerviche, which wasn't impressive at all. A cold scallop with pico de gallo. Blah. . . Their salad bar Aka Harvest Table is also impressive with tons of different salads, breads with tons of classy spreads, cuts of ham and cheeses. . . The worst offender was the lack of meat! Where the fuck was their meat people?! Once again the lamb guys came around like 800 times when the steak cuts came once and by the end when we were so busy stuffing our faces with side dishes because the lack of meat guys.. . EPIC FAIL. Should have gone to Fogo's.
