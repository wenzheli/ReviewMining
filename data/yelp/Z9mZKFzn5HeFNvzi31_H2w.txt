Ok...so...I'm probably gonna get shit about this....but. . I don't really "get" the whole Deep Dish Pizza thing....it's whatever . :: shrugging ::. . Sooo while visiting Chicago...it was told to another party who then told me that "you HAVE to go to Gino's East"...so to Gino's East we went.... . Don't know what I was really expecting...since to me a deep dish is just the same old pizza (same cheese, same sauce, same toppings)..just deeper...you know like those new deep mattresses...shit...still feels like a mattress to me on top...it's just 4 more inches in depth...so what? ...it's not like it turns from regular old run of the mill mozzarella to magical life inspiring, melt-in-your-mouth, ethereal too-good-to-be-true MOZZaRELLA! :: doing jazz fingers :::. . But anyway...back to my review.... . Upon entering you immediately smell the delicious smells of mmmm  pizza ...       :: auuuggghhhhh :: melting cheese, oven baked goodness!! (hey!  just cause I don't get the big deal behind deep dish don't mean I don't like pizza - good pizza...I should say) Additionally, there is writing all over the walls... of the jockeys that were there before me.... Believe it or not..I started to worry...wondering if I had enough class....but it was Saturday Night!! I guess that makes it all right!!! . ....ahem...sorry....so I like the idea of that...everyone who had been there...locals, out of towners...the LOT of them!! all on the walls to entertain you while you wait to be seated, and subsequently while you wait for your 45 minute pizza...(why didn't I write my name on the wall, or the seat, or the ANYTHING?!?!? Aauuuughh! - so if you go there...have a sharpie with you so you can tag...SOMETHING!) . . We ordered the salad and Deep Dish with chicken and spinach and maybe some other stuff...I dont' know..... . Upon arrival...it looked good enough....the MOZZaRELLA!! :: jazz fingers :: WAS kinda sparkling...haha kidding... . We immediatley noticed the crust looked like a cheesecake crust but thought ...whatever...so we bit in and was like whaaaaa IS THAT?!?!? It was some sort of corn bread-y, cakeish, crumb-like crust...that...I just couldn't get down for...I'm sorry...it was ok..but give me regular ass dough anyday... . . I like the ambience of the place, and the waiters/staff were cool folk, our guy seemed like he was from new york and was kinda no nonsense I know what's good so order what I tell you which I don't like...lemme ask whatever and however many questions I want to get my meal how I WANT IT...I understand recommendations and all...but don't get all impatient with me...shit...you doin' yo job!!. . So all in all..I thought it was cool...if you in the area and you wanna try some (I guess) Authentic "Chicago" Deep Dish Pizza go ahead...but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.... . I'm just sayin....
