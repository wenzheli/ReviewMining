Restaurant: Milk &amp; Honey Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I heard a lot of hype about Milk and Honey, and when I went I wasn't disappointed. The line was efficient, the food was really good (shared huevos rancheros and the fruit and yogurt with a buddy). The coffee was tasty and the price was really really reasonable. . . The cafe is cute and pleasant and I particularly got a kick out of having a tiny little cupcake for dessert at the take out counter.. Recommend this place and I'll be back.
