Restaurant: Glenn&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
Don't let the sign fool you. It may actually be the Best Food in the World!. . If you want seafood that's fresh and top quality. Try Glenn's Diner right now. Their "First Catch" special is the best deal in the house. For about $12 you get a nice piece of fish, vegetable, potato, soup and salad. Unreal.. . Plus the brunch items are all really great. Get there early on a Sunday or you gonna wait . I'd highly recommend this joint. Really.
