This is not the best place for Pho. Its good Pho and the variety of other foods is excellent and I think that's why so many people come here. I usually like to order their spring rolls and their pork egg rolls with Pho. There's tons of other food but I never get it. Though I do sometimes look over at other people's dishes and wished I could order something else besides Pho. I wish I wasn't a Pho addict!! They have good fresh fruit bubble tea and when I'm in the mood and with the right company, I order a young coconut. OH, and you can't beat the prices. I think this place is good for those of you who are new to Vietnamese food.
