Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
This is as good as it gets.  CHEAP. FRESH. DELICIOUS.  Don't be turned off by a line at the door.  It's worth the 20 minute wait for the best pasta around and for less than $10 a plate.  Stop by for their half priced wine bottles night to really impress your friends.  Since moving out of this city this is one of my top restaurants on my must visit list when I'm in the city.
