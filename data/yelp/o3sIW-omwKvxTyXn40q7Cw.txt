I have dreamed of eating here for several years before I finally had the opportunity this past birthday.   Oprah raved about Tru, friends raved about Tru, but sadly, I am not going to 'rave' about Tru.  I was disappointed. Perhaps I expected more than it could produce.  But come on, it's TRU!!  The 3 course prix fixe menu was ok for me but we ordered an extra appetizer. Why do the apps always sound more appealing than the entrees?? Anyway, we ordered the prime beef tartare with a golden egg, the peeky toe crab salad, prime beef ribeye, and moroccan lamb three ways.  The prime beef tartare was by far the tastiest. The golden egg is worth it! It's a raw egg yolk enveloped by edible gold leaf. How euphoric!!  It was well-seasoned and accented by the saltiness of the parmesan tuile.  I could eat this over and over again. The peeky toe salad was fresh tasting. Not particular satisfying in any way. The eggplant, crab and vinaigrette all had about the same taste. I must not have gotten enough of the acid on my plate because it tasted bland to me.  I love peeky toe which on its own is very sweet but the eggplant puree took away from the peeky toe.  The entrees were not memorable therefore I won't really write about them. Needless to say not the best performance by Rick Tramonto (I don't know even know if he was working that night)!  Plus our waiter was a little odd and unattentive.  Not really worth the price.
