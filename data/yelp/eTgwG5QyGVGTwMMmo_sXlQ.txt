I came here with a group for four people on a Thursday night. I was not over crowded and I can not say enough good things! . . We had bacon wrapped shrimp, dates, and coconut shrimp as appetizers and all of them were excellent. I had the ropa vieja for dinner and it was excellent! The Havana light martini had real toasted coconut flakes in it and it was amazing! For dessert the guava cheesecake and the pistachio cake were both amazing, . . I will definitely be back!
