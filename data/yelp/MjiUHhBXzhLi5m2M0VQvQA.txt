I've eaten here several times and they have consistently put out good food.  The ribs, calamari, and rigatoni alle baressa (spicy sausage with pasta and chicken) are my favorites.  The thin crust pizza is also very good. I like the fact that the pizza sauce is on the spicy side.  I definitely recommend ordering pizza from this place if you are entertaining a big group of people watching a  Saturday afternoon college football game. . . I recommend calling for reservations.  It gets crazy packed on the weekends.
