Two weekends in a row I've sat at the counter, read yet another British motorcycle magazine wishing for that next half-way decent weather day to take a bike out for a long rider and had their Crab Cake Eggs Benedict.  . . Good God!  This may be the most amazing breakfast dish I have ever had...Okay, maybe number 2 to the lobster benedict my wife and I had once at brunch at the Peninsula Hotel...but this is so close!!!!
