The breakfast deserves 3.5 stars. Really good food, nothing exceptional, better than average. Though I was hoping for a little more excitement from the Huevos Rancheros.. . Service at the Division location is what killed the rating. Apparently all your party must be there before you get your "number card" sat on a table, even if you've ordered and paid. At least that is what we were told, after all the tables were taken from people behind us still in line. From this point the staff simply became more and more rude to us. Unfortunate really.. . There are plenty of exceptional places to eat in this city with a lot smaller list of rules and guidelines, not to mention quite a bit more tolerable staff.. . UPDATE: The granola is exceptional, and can be purchased from some local grocers. Still can't bring myself back in the Division location, maybe I will give the Damen store a try.
