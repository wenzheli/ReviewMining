Luis F you are right this place is awesome!  Thanks to you guys I crave a good relleno taco or steak burrito very often, now that I live in Dallas.  I have been going to La Pasadita for about 10 years.  I like to go to the two that are on the west side of Ashland.  My favorite thing to get is one relleno taco and two steak tacos, I know it's a lot but I can't help it.  Your horchata is also very good and definitely you won't need a refill when you order the large.  I read an article where Nicholas Cage visited and he was just raving about the food, great work guys.  Next time I go to Chicago I will try to stop by either La Pasadita or Las Asadas.
