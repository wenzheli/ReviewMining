This has to be one of the best places to eat. They bring all of your food on skewers piping hot. The food is almost orgasmic. From the different red meat selection to the lamb and chicken. Some wrapped in bacon. Very clean and trendy. A little pricy at fifty bucks per person, but it's all you can eat. Doesn't get better then that.
