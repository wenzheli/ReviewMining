Restaurant: Sapori Trattoria
Category: Italian
Sapori is one of the few commercial Italian restaurants I legitimately like. The chicken/pesto gnocchi and butternut squash ravioli in sage butter are incredibly tasty and not too heavy. The calimari friti are well-seasoned and perfectly crispy. I have been to Sapori 5 or 6 times, and each time my group has been very satisfied. The wine pairings are really nice, and the presentation is beautiful.. . The staff is also incredibly nice and helpful. I went to Sapori for a celebratory dinner, which I told the staff about when making our reservation - and they printed special menus for our group, congratulating the guest of honor. Personal touches like that definitely mean something.. . My only negatives are: 1) the restaurant is relatively small and can get pretty crowded and loud (though the outdoor seating is very nice in the warmer months, and can be very romantic); and 2) the spaghetti bolognese/lasagna were nothing to write home about. Maybe I'm just biased in favor of my mom's, though.. . I would absolutely recommend Sapori to all my friends looking for a great new neighborhood Italian spot. I would just encourage them to branch out and try something different than the usual lasagna/spaghetti.
