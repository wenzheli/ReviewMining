Restaurant: The Fifty/50
Category: Sports Bars
The Yelp! assemblage at Chocolate Grape was at capacity. Those who couldn't get in there went here. When the Chocolate Grape event ended, the 'second wave' of Yelpers went here also. I was in that second wave.. There are a *lot* of bars now on this span of Division St. The Fifty/50 [It *does not* have a citrus/grapefruit soda originally produced by the A. J. Canfield Company {and which is still packaged} - booo].. I must also alert you that this venue is a little on the money-grubbing side. There are only four beers on draft [if all the taps are working ~ one was not on Monday evening], and the table tent tells you what they are. They cost $5.00. . They are not called "pints". They could not be. But they also serve you your draft in the *fake* pint glass [fourteen ounces - booo hiss]. I am sorry people, but this is exactly about what "Beer Advocate" magazine is warning everybody. When I encounter venues utilizing the fake pint glass, I will announce it. If you go here, give the staff here the hard word.. The post-event party was along the division between the indoor and outdoor portions of Fifty/50. If you want to *not* view what is on the televisions here, choose the outdoor patio and face easterly. Even then you might catch a mirror reflection of one of the TVs from a jersey display. The venue has satellite television with the M.L.B. 'Extra Innings' package. (Which it utilizes. The out-of-market game being shown here Monday night was Kansas City @ Baltimore. [A.L.]). Food is also featured. The specials have a theme. This week's{?} were seafood and crustaceans from the mid-Atlantic region. I didn't eat anything here.. It is a nice enough venue otherwise. But the riff-raff with the drafts rankles me, and its bottled selection is not that great either. (A 12-ounce bottle of Rogue Dead Guy Ale costs $6.) The attraction is going to be with whomever you visit here. If you want a venue that is more strident about either beer or food, this is not the venue to hit.. Transit options: The #70 Division runs eastbound from here until 12:50 am. The #50 Damen northbound quits absurdly early at 10:30 pm. The Blue Line "L"'s Division station is five blocks east.
