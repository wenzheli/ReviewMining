Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Living in the loop, finding a good breakfast can be surprisingly hard. Unfortunately I live on the north-end of the loop and Yolk is located on the south-end, but I happily make the trek. Parking in the area can be a big problem, however.. . This place is white, clean and brightly lit-perfect to keep me awake in the morning. I have only ever gone to Yolk for breakfast... even if it is a bit past breakfast time. They have the usual breakfast fare plus a few of their own unique creations. Everything I've tried so far has been delicious. They also have some freshly squeezed juice that is typically overpriced. Unfortunately I am a sucker for the strawberry-orange juice, so I shell out the money for it every time and happily drink it down. Oh, the things I would do for that strawberry-orange juice.... . The biggest downside to Yolk is that it can get PACKED in the morning on weekends. Be prepared to wait. They have a small waiting room, however last I was there, they had no chairs or benches. People were standing, sitting and laying all over the hardwood floor room. I felt like I was in a cattle pen...
