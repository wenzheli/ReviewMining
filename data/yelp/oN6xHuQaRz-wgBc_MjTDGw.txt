We had planned to go here at 7pm on a Saturday night, which is the only reason why this has 4 stars instead of 5 - we showed up around 6:30pm and were told that it would be a 45 minute wait.  During this time, however, there was someone from the restaurant coming out to offer us free snacks!. . My husband and I shared a pizza - it was just big enough.  Next time we might each get our own and then we'd have a bit of leftovers.  The crust was crisp, but towards the center of the pizza it was a bit more soggy (but in a goof way).  . . There was also a pretty large wine list - we ended up having a bottle of red that cost under $30, although there were some that cost as much as $80.  . . Now that I've been to this restaurant I will be sure to go back again and again.
