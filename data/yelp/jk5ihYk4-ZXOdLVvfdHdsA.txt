Order some carryout, slap some fat pants on me, and plant me in front of the TV.  I could not ask for anything more in life.  DEEP DISH to the extreme.  It's amazing.  I start off being dainty and cut off the first pieces with a fork and knife...then I move to jamming the thing in my mouth, next thing you know I'm stealing slices off other people's plates.  Never tried the thin crust, I leave that for Pizza Metro.
