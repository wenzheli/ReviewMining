Category: Greek
They keep the bread coming at the Greek Islands which I enjoy. The vegetarian Mousaka was very good as well as the Spanakopita. I got the combo plate which was a great choice because I could have a little bit of both of these dishes. The greek salad was great with massive hunks of feta. I finished the meal off with the creme caramel dessert which was similar to a mexican flan and just as good! Definitely not very health conscious but worth the occasional splurge!
