sushi is the best sushi you can ever get in the city or anywhere else. Rolls are creative and the combinations of the flavors and textures are genius. I come here all the time and service has always been excellent despite the fact that it is always crowded. The ginger salad is my favorite there is something about the dressing that sends me to heaven everytime i take a bite. They are not stingy with their fish, Plus its byob and there is absolutely no corkage fee. I love sushi x!
