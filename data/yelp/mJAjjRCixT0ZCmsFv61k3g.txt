OMGosh!!! They just don't make business like this anymore (unfortunately). I just went here a couple days ago for the first time. It's a small family owned business which I love. I met the Father, and the Son who explained the entire history of the business. It's great to still find passionate people who love what they do for a living. They really put their heart and soul into this food and the proof is in the TASTE!! I had the Lechon sandwich a pork sandwich with plantains AWESOME!! You must try this place or your seriously missing out.
