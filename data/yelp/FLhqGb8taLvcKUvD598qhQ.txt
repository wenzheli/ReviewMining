I thought this place was great.  I went with a friend on 9/1/08.  We had a 20 min. wait which we spent at the bike store next to Yolk.. . Great atmosphere.  Fast-friendly service.  Clean.  Big portions.  Great prices.  Yummy "orange/strawberry juice!"  I had a GREAT omelet and my friend had a skillet dish.  We both got pancakes on the side and we were in heaven.  These were the best pancakes we have had to date.  They were light yet a bit crispy on the edges with a perfect flavor.  We both loved our brunch and will go back again!
