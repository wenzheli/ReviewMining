Pork cheek and potato pizza?  It's like 3 servings of bacon with hash browns served up on a crust.  This was my third visit and I'm delighted to say each visit has sustained the high standard from my first impression.    Excellent appetizers, choice of Italian beers and entrees are punctuated by table visits from the chef with one bite samples crafted a few feet away from the table.  I recommend sitting near the ovens so you can watch them working the pizza dough before putting it inside the authentic italian oven.   . . For a similar bite in Wicker Park check out Crust and it's range of organic pizzas and vast organic beer selection.
