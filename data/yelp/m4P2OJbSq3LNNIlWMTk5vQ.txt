I think the initial hype has worn off... and I like this place better because of it.. . I can actually find a seat on a Saturday now. And the owner, who was already friendly, is a bit more approachable. I felt like he was surrounded by groupies before.. it was weird. . . And the sandwiches taste better now, ALMOST making the price tag seem reasonable (a little under $7). I had TWO of the bistec when I tried their new version because it surprised me how good it was--I just had to have another! . . I've tried 2 of their empanadas and have not been impressed. I'll just stick to my bistec sandwich and leave a happy camper. . . The last time I came, my dog had just been treated at the emergency vet down the block and we were hanging out at the tables outside. My husband said Yoshi (my dog) needed to take a painkiller but Yoshi hates pills unless they're wrapped in cheese. I offered 90 Miles a dollar and asked them for a piece of cheese in exchange but they gave it to me for free. My dog and I THANK YOU!! The fact that I wasn't yelled at about having my large boxer with me is worth the extra star. There's so many places that either the owner or the patrons start to complain.. but the customers were too busy 'aww'ing my dog to say anything that day. ;). . PS. It is no longer cash only
