So I may be a brunch snob, but Yolk truly lacks the "wow" factor.  Sure, it's decent food served at reasonable prices for the hungry mass of S. Loop.  But, alas, it is only mediocre at best.  Having been to the other Yolk location in River North (and equally underwhelming experience), I wasn't thrilled with this last-minute, starvation-driven decision to brunch at Yolk one lazy Sat afternoon.  Nevertheless, I endured the 25-minute wait (?!?) with an open mind and forgiving spirits.. . Seated at the counter, we started off with freshly squeezed (i.e., fresh out of a costco-sized plastic bottle as we witnessed over the counter) juice.  Rather quickly, our food came out.  My STEAK SKILLET was bland.  I did like, however, that they substituted my eggs with egg whites for no additional cost.  His EGGS FLORENTINE was also just ok.  Nothing special about any of their dishes.  The home fries were soggy and tasteless.  The fruits not so fresh.  The butter served in factory-packaged, individual-size plastic cups.  . . Unless you're in the area and starving enough to settle for Yolk, choose one of many other fabulous brunch options Chicago has to offer.
