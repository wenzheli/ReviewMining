Many thanks to Angel S. for the tips in her review!  She was definitely right on, and if we hadn't followed them we would have too full to eat some of the best meats they brought.  What a pleasant night!  The manager is wonderful, the servers some of the best in all of Illinois, and the bartender makes a great drink.  It's a bit on the pricey side, but definitely worth every penny that you pay.  You'll feel like a celebrity after leaving, they treat you that well.
