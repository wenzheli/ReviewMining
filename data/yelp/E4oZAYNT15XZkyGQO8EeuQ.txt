Every time I go here I have to order the chicken ph! Even though I rarely am able to act my age and control myself when I see cow penis on the menu. (*giggle*). . The taro bubble tea is also one of my favorite items they have... kind of a mix between blueberry and vanilla.. . Definitely check it out if you're in the mood to try something new. They do get packed but the tables turn over very quickly!
