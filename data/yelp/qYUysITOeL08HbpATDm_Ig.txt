Restaurant: Brazzaz
Category: Steakhouses
Third Brazillian Place I've gone to (three different states: CT, CA, IL) and I really can't distinguishd the three anymore (partly 'cuz I don't know much about steak and meat). With this in mind, I think Brazzaz's meat's tender, fresh, and tasty. . . I went for lunch and the atmosphere was much more relaxed than, I'd imagine, going for dinner. Just like the other places I've visited, Brazzaz had great sweet friend banana and mash potato. What really stuck out was their salad bar. Great variety and great seasonings! I especially loved the strawberry dressing and enjoyed the Chef's special salad (the one with potato chips). . . Overall, I give the place a 4/5 just because I'm having a hard time distinguishing it from the other two places I've visited. Oh, also price to beat for lunch (just about $24+) for a nicer lunch. (Agoura in Irvine, CA charges the same for lunch and dinner.)
