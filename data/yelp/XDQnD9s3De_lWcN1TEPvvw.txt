I have friends in high places.  Which is very nice when you decide that you want to go out to eat somewhere really swanky..at 7pm..on a holiday.. . My friends with connections made a few calls and we had no problem.  Parking, no problem.  Walking in ahead of a long line and lead to a table right away and seated with a smile, no problem.  Gotta love that.. . I was immediately impressed.  The decor is sexy, and the atmosphere is super romantic.  And then there was the food!. . We had been out on a boat all day and I had worked up an appetite, so when I sauntered up to the starters tables I did not know what to do with myself.  So much to choose from!  I could have eaten just that, but no, then came the roving meat.  I was so gluttonous that I really cannot remember what I had, but I can tell you that it was all delicious.. . After dinner we were treated to a tour by a head-honcho.  Beautiful private rooms, gorgeous outdoor deck for drinking and socializing.  . . A place to see and be seen without the regular "ugh" I feel at most places like this.  Would love to go on a date here.
