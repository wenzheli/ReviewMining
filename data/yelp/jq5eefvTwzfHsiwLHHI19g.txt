I was rather offended by the menu describing their greek salad as being authentic.  Authentic greek salads consist entirely of feta, tomato, cucumber, olives, and onion, topped with olive oil and spices.  Note: lettuce is not an ingredient in a greek salad.  . . The greek salad at Greek Islands is almost entirely lettuce.  It came with one slice of tomato, one cucumber, a tiny square of feta cheese, and two olives.  This is pretty typical for an american greek salad.  There is no way it can be called authentic.  . . The other dishes I had were so-so.
