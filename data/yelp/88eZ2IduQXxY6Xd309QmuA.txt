I adore this place -- it's adorable, unpretentious, and they serve great tapas. They don't take reservations, so either come early or be ready to wait for a table or bar seat. But it is worth the wait -- delicious small plates and a great wine list await. I recommend the fried chickpeas and/or the baguette that comes with 3 spreads (olive tapenade, fava bean, and pepper/onion salsa). The cheese plates are also wonderful -- had a delicious manchego last time I was here.
