Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
I only had one thing I wanted to do on my first visit to Chicago...eat real Chicago style deep dish pizza...and that happened.  My friend recommended that I try Giordano's, so my sister and I finally found this place after wandering aimlessly in the cold.  . . I wouldn't recommend the fried calamari because it came out drenched in oil, and it was not crispy at all. It was a disappointment.  We ordered the Special stuffed crust pizza- sausage mushrooms, green peppers, and onions. It took awhile for it to come out, but it was a good wait. The pizza was very cheesy and saucy; very hearty.  One slice was very filling, so we had plenty of left overs.  I was just bummed that we didn't get to finish the left overs the following day since we had no fridge in our hotel room. . . Overall, I enjoyed the pizza.
