Restaurant: Milk &amp; Honey Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Should of came on a Sat or Sun for some of their famous huevos rancheros.  Instead we were here on a Thursday morning and was it humming with people.  Definitely didn't expect it to be busy at all!. . Went with the orange brioche french toast and can't seem to remember what the dining partner ordered.  Obviously, not memorable.   French toast was good but not in my top 3.  I think we ordered the wrong things...next time trying the huevos rancheros and the granola.. . I didn't get the appeal of the restaurant. There's too many other brunch places in the city to try and give my patronage too.
