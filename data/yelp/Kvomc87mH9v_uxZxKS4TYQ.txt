Restaurant: Uncommon Ground
Category: American (New)
This Uncommon Ground location has never been a terribly close or convenient dining option for me, but I've been here a few times because friends really like it. The atmosphere of the dining rooms are what appeal to me most - the food has had it's ups &amp; downs, mostly good but not mind-blowing. If not for the cozy &amp; comfortable surroundings I might give the dining experience a so-so overall review. I've been here for both brunch &amp; dinner, and I have definitely much preferred the brunch experience - service is friendly and attentive, the coffee is good &amp; strong, and the bloody marys are thick &amp; spicy.  It's sometimes more chaotic &amp; busy in the evenings, and service suffers a bit especially if there's a live show going on.  They have a teeny parking lot which fills fast but I've been lucky to find a spot most times I've visited.. . Wouldn't travel way out of my way to dine here, but it's a good solid choice if you happen to be up in the Rogers Park/Edgewater area.
