Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
For the price, this place is pretty impressive. I went here last Saturday for dinner. Our server was nice, quick and attentive. I had the pesto, which was very, very good. I would assume an inexpensive restaurant like Pasta Bowl would skimp out on an expensive ingredient like whole pine nuts, but there were plenty in my pasta! It's also connected to The Other Side bar. You can be in the bar and order pasta, which is a nice setup in case one side is busier than the other. I went here for the first time a couple of months ago and had the linguine with clams, which was pretty good, but the pesto was much better in my opinion. I highly recommend if you are on a budget and looking for quality pasta.
