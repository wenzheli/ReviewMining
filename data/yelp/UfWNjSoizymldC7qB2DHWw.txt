Restaurant: Sapori Trattoria
Category: Italian
Yes, Italian food is Italian food. It's tough to be impeccable when you are serving pasta &amp; sauce.. . However, Sapori is outstanding. If you like lobster, you MUST get the Lobster Ravioli.  It is by far the best Lobster Ravioli I have ever had. Plus all the pasta is made fresh, so it makes it that much better.. . Also, try the small plate of ribs.  I know you don't go to Italian restaurants for ribs, but after you try these (made with honey, etc.) you will ask yourself why you didn't order these sooner.
