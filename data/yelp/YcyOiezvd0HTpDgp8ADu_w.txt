This place is great!!! I love that its BYOB and the sushi tastes fresh. All together my  meal was cheap and I loved that I didn't have to sacrifice taste for what I paid. The staff was friendly. I've been here at least 4 times and I've loved it more everytime. The decor is fun and you just really enjoy yourself.
