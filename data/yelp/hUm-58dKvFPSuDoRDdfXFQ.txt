Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
I was so badly anticipating this place.  It let me down, not the food (or else I'd be SO mad) but more so the service.. . The food is delicious- I had the farfalle pollo (without the chicken since I'm a vegetarian), bruschetta (which was ok, cold), caprese (delicious) and my friend had the ravioli which was good too.  The only bad thing about Pasta Bowl, which is why it receives a -2 stars, is its HORRIBLE service.  I understand it was packed, and they were understaffed, but the waiter kept complaining about it and ridiculously told us to "make it quick."  I cannot believe someone would have the audacity to say that - he received perhaps a 10% tip.  I'm not too sure if he is the balding waiter, but he sucked nevertheless.  Real bad!
