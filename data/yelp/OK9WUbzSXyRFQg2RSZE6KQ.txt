Restaurant: Mayan Palace Mexican Cuisine
Category: Mexican
I recently moved to Chicago from Memphis where I had a favorite Mexican restaurant that I would eat at nearly once a week. Now that I am living in the Windy City I have been on a search for a new favorite. And I think I have found it. My wife and I went there the other night after 10pm (they are open until 11pm Sunday-Thursday and midnight Friday-Saturday). Upon sitting down, we were offered the standard chips and salsa (Warning: the salsa has a bit of spice to it.) We also ordered guacamole as an appetizer which was not only quite tasty but plentiful. For the main meal, I got the Steak Enchilada Supreme which comes with rice and beans. Like the salsa, the dish here had a little spice to it. And while certainly not overpowering by any means, it might be a little too much for those who like their dishes mild. Myself, I like the little kick and the meal was quite delicious. Also, the dish was clearly served with very fresh ingredients. As for the restaurant itself, the place was small but charming and relaxed. And the service was very prompt and generous. I am definitely looking forward to future visits.
