I must say I was shocked and how awesome this place was and have since enjoyed everything I've ever eaten here. The fish is always fresh and their lobster tail sized shrimp are delish! The crab cakes are large as well and are basically just crab - not a bunch of crappy filler and breadcrumbs. . . The last 2 times there I have gotten a blackboard fish with a spicy diablo sauce with shrimp - SO good but really spicy - you will need to fill up your water glass several times!. . I always get a side of their mac &amp; cheese (even though they won't substitute the potatoes for it) but it's just that good. I will barely eat all day just to have it! Damn now I want to go!. . Have yet to make it for the all you can eat crab legs night or brunch but both are on my to do list.
