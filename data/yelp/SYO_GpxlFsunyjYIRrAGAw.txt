I went here because another yelp review said it would be a great place for a first date. This could be true if you're a 19-year-old sophomore at Depaul. I, unfortunately, am not, and neither was my date. . . Crowded and small, I was bumped into multiple times by servers. . It's fast Italian food; they brought our meals within five minutes after we received our appetizer. . The calamari was pretty good, and the food was worth the insanely cheap price.
