I've been here twice now and I'm not completely won over by it's fantastic-ness.  I'm also pretty certain I'll be going back.  How to reconcile the two?  Here it is:. . The food is quality for cheap.  The pasta dish I had was excellent and the portion was enormous.  The left-overs were even great...cold.  The pasta will call me back and certainly the price will too.. . My issue with this place both times has been the service.  It's slow.  It's not awesome.  The last time I was there (with Meghan B.) and her drink came out with lipstick marks on the glass.  I was semi-gagging as it sat there on the table for a good 10-15 minutes before there was a "check-up" that would allow for remedying that situation.  AND, I felt there wasn't enough "Oh my god...I'm so sorry"-ing going on.  When the server returned with the drink he said, "I even gave you a fresh glass of wine."  Well DUH.  That's what I would have EXPECTED.  Something like that happens (and I'm saying the lipstick was egregious...and did I already say disgusting), I'm thinking comping that drink wouldn't be totally wrong.. . Anyway, a great place for lunch/dinner.  Very good food for the price.  I just want them to be a smidge more attentive.
