Restaurant: La Pasadita
Category: Mexican
I never tend to critique food I get when I'm drunk on a Friday night too much but La Pasadita was terrible.  I got a burrito and the steak was so tough I got through about two bites before my jaw gave out.  I chewed each bite about 100 times and could still barely swollow it.  I threw it out.  Why do you open up three of the same restaurant in one block?  To trick people into buying the same crap food three times.
