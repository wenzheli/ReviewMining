We dropped in recently to check out this new eatery which is on the corner of Clark and Foster in the heart of Andersonville.  The first bad sign was that it was almost totally empty at 8 pm on a Thursday night.. . The food, while not exceptionally flavorful, was certainly overpriced.  $8.50 is a lot for some veggies in a crepe shell.  You can add meat for $3, if you don't mind paying almost $12 for a crepe.  You can order tea, for example, but then you're paying about $3 for a single serving of Stash tea.  . . Service was polite but gradually became slower and slower as our meal continued.  We had our credit card on the table for some time before our server came by to say that they didn't (yet) accept credit cards.  It took us about 30 minutes to pay and leave.  . . Overall, there's nothing special here, and you pay too much for what you get.  If you plan to eat cheaply, go to Taste of Lebanon on Foster around the corner.  If you're planning to spend more, head somewhere else on Clark.
