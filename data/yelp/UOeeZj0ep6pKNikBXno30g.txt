Restaurant: Artopolis Bakery &amp; Cafe
Category: Bakeries
I've only ever ordered one thing at Artopolis, and that's because it's the first thing I ever ordered there and it's so good I can't branch out (if you must know, the chicken and mozzarella artopita). I also like the feel of the restaurant and how it's open to the outside. Finally, I like that I can just swing by and grab something to go--faster than fast food and much tastier.  The only bad thing I could possibly say about Artopolis is that there's no flaming cheese, and I do enjoy watching a big plate of flaming cheese go by. Opa!
