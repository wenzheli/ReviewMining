While the sushi is fair to middlin' - with an occassional innovative twist and the one-in-while off tasting piece of fish there are plenty of other great places within walking distance.. . It is with the service that this place really suffers, taking it's diners along for the bumpy ride. Though we have had a pseudo-friendly server occasionally it is the exception. Most present themselves as seeming far too cool for your time and are brusque and, at times, rude. . . Even if one craves sushi which is accompanied with a side of cool, as I admit I occasionally do, there are far better places that do the cool with a least passing interest in your enjoyment as a diner.
