The server took foreverrrrr!!  She took a good 5 minutes to take our drink order, dropped the drinks off without even giving us a second to say "were ready to order!" and didn't come back for 20 minutes to take our food order. . When we asked for a good appetizer recommendation, she suggested the Prosciutto with arugala &amp; Parmesan. .  It was literally a few strips of meat SOAKED in oil, like each piece literally DRIPPING in oil when I picked it up. Then the oily meat was topped with a mound of dry arugula lettuce &amp; a few pieces of Parmesan. NOT appetizing!! . Then came our main order-  the Funghi Pizza (pizza with mushrooms). The sauce had no taste to it, let alone there was hardly any sauce on the pizza, and the pizza itself was soggy. . Both my friend and I were NOT impressed with the food at all. Plus, beyond pizza there are no other choices except different variations of anti-pasti (almost all including the oily prosciutto..ick)  . I understand the place offers traditional Italian fare, but I would suggest adding some salads, soups, or mozzerella sticks for variety...and some more sauce to your pizzas!
