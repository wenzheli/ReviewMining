Restaurant: Sun Wah Bar-B-Que
Category: Chinese
It was a treat coming here for our first meal (feast might be more accurate) of the Chinese New Year, courtesy of our nephew.  I can't imagine a better Peking Duck, and for reference, I've had it in Beijing, at the famous place by the Emperor's Summer Palace (I had to look it up out of curiosity - Quan Jude).  Sun Wah's new location on Broadway is really nice for an authentic Chinese place - spacious, clean, comfortable with big tables, and with maybe the largest dining room in either of our two Chinatowns.  Dining room has a modern loft feel to it with exposed brick walls and ductwork.  . . BBQ chicken was also uniquely tasty - with deeply marinated BBQ flavor and crispy skin, and juicy white meat underneath.  The highlight though was the duck, which was expertly carved tableside by Kelly, the senior sibling co-owner of Sun Wah.  The crispy skin slices were expertly thin with meat attached, making for a lot of duck portions for our buns.  I only know her name is Kelly because of the Tribune's timely article on the place this week.  I'm assuming I won't be fined by Yelp for posting this third party link:. . . http://www.chicagotrib.... . . Ok, service was a litle slow on the duck, but the place was packed, and I think you have to factor in the value aspect, which was excellent as we had several other excellent courses as well.  So overall, I think the value offset the little slower service on a packed New Year's Day Sunday, so I still go with 5 stars.. . We'll defiinitely be back.   This place is another example (like Chi Cafe in old Chinatown) of how Chicago Chinatown dining is rapidly changing for the better with the times.    . . ps - Besides street parking, and at least on the weekends, there are a couple of narrow parking lots nearby on Broadway you can pull into (sign is labeled employee and visitor parking).
