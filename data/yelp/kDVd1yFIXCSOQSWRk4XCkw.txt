With the five-star rating being reserved for sheer, utter perfection, I am giving Mayan Place four.  . . The decor: Great, especially with the idyllic snow scene happening outside.  There were some splashes of reddish brown which was also very eye catching.  If you can, sit toward the front.  It's nicer.. . I haven't eaten snow since I was seven, so, on with the review:. . I can't vouch for Mayan's claim of "best in the world" but my Jamaican Flower margarita was top notch.  Word has it that their lime margarita is similarly killer.  This word comes from someone who has been to Guatemala. . . Another five stars to the Red Snapper, which was described to me as "insane".  I would add to that, abso-freekin-lutely.  . . As precious few people are aware, I love to explain myself using rhetorical questions.  And, so, I fake ask you, what is a vegetarian dish without beans?  Not much to write home about, that's for sure.  That is exactly what my margarita-hopping partner received.  Granted, this is not Earwax Cafe, but, still, vegetarians need beans to feel full *(New England Journal of Medicine, p 93-94).
