Man Listen.  It's the best, hands down. I make it a point to go here each time I visit Chi... "Deep Dish? F' that, gimmie some carne from Pasadita!" . . I'm still trying to figure out how they fit an entire cow into the burrito. I'm talkin 100% BOVINE. Carne Asada burrito to be exact. Add cilantro, cheese, and guac... we have ourselves a winner. You're gonna need a day to let the digestive system readjust after this one. You probably cut about 2 days off of your life if you finish the whole thing :-p I haven't been there in almost 3 years, but I can still taste it! . . And its CHEAP!
