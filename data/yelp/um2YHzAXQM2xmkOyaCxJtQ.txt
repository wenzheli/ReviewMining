Okay, I know it is going to sound like I have a sensitivity to light given that this is the second time that I will talk about how bright a restaurant is.  It is a bit bright in here...and my friend noticed it first.  I met some friends here who had arrived 15 minutes before I had so I did not have to wait long when I got here.  But they had servers walking around serving bites of pizza, cheeses, etc to the people waiting in line...totally cool.  The smell in here is phenomenal.  The kitchen is open, which gives it a cafe/bistro type feel.  The pizzas are really good.  They look like they are bigger than they really are though because the crust is actually really thin.  We ordered one pizza for our table of three women and we each has an Insalata Mista to start.  We could have had another pizza so that we could have one more piece and keep the leftovers, but we decided to get the spumoni dessert instead.  The dessert was great and the other options that we peeked at on other peoples' tables looked great too (especially the tiramisu!).  The ingredients on the pizzas are really fresh and delicious.  They use buffalo mozzarella.  If you like a lot of sauce on your pizza this isn't for you (unless they have a pizza that you can order with more sauce).  There is very little sauce and mostly toppings.  I thought it was very delicious.  I will definitely go back here again and it is great that it is right around the corner from me!
