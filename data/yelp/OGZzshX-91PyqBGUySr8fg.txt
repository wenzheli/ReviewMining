Restaurant: Calo Ristorante
Category: Pizza
Calo is an up-scale italian restuarant in Andersonville that does one thing I find just great....serves food until 2am during the week.. . I sometimes have cravings for late night dinners...and though a pizza and a few beers isn't the best of dinners it definitely hits the spot.. . The bar is the best please for such dining in the late night hours.  The bar tender meets your needs and you can eat while either talking with friends, watching one of 3 TVs (one is a HUGE projection tv in the back) or reading.  Regardless, in the summer time, front of the establishment opens all the windows making the summer even better.. . I had only the pizza and thin crust too boot, but it was done just right and a small is big enough for two people to share.  At $12 one could walk out of there for under $20 for two people which is always a plus in my book.. . The decore has a lounge feel to it with dark wood, candles and simple decorations.  Music was a bit ol' school, but I liked it.
