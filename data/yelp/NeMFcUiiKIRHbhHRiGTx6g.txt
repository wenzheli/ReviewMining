I come here so often.... so I can't believe I haven't written a review yet!  You can find me here just about every Saturday AM.  I just can't get enough.  The menu is pretty limited but what they do they do it well!. . When you first walk in and see the massive line don't be discouraged!  The wait usually isn't as long as you think it's going to be.  Wait it out and you'll be glad you did.  Once you stick your fork into the cheesy, melty, top layer of the Huevos Rancheros (my standby AND it's vegetarian for when I'm in an anti-meat mood, which is often) you'll be glad you stuck around.  And what is that dipping sauce they serve with it?  It's probably glorified sour cream but I have dreams about it.  My boyfriend (who is the biggest carnivore ever) is obsessed with the Huevos Rancheros too--it's that good. . . Place your order and get a coffee to sip on while you wait...you'll be seated before you know it.  I promise, once you eat their delicious food you'll forget all about the hectic lines and find yourself right back there the next week.  Get a glass of OJ too--some of the best I've had!
