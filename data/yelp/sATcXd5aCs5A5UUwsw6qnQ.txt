Restaurant: Alinea
Category: American (New)
Gastronomical extravaganza. Phenomenal. Exquisite. Alinea is a once in a lifetime experience. The service was nothing the previous reviews stated. Far from pretentious, the staff was knowledgeable, even down to the bus boy who can describe the food as well as the captain. The food cannot be described by layman's terms. Favorite course was the wagyu beef pared with potato custard encrusted in salt and vinegar chips served with powdered A-1, finished with a smoking, grill scented, centerpiece. To make a long story short, you will never want to eat beef any other way again in your lifetime. Go, fly fly, experience it for yourself.
