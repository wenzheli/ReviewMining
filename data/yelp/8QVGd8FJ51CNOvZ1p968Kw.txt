This is for you, Din Tai Fung.. . "I met her at a backyard. blockparty by the bar.. And she kept lookin' at me. like she knew who I was.. She was buzzin' all over me.. She was buzzin' all over me.. She was buzzin' all over me. like she fell in love.. . Bang bang baby shot. me in the heart, in the dark,. with the *** of the spark. when it hit.. When we me at the spot. it was hot, like this song. saw the thong, it was on.. Now it's 8 in the mornin'. I move on like the Greyhound bus. I go town to town. and I prey on sluts.. I got to go,. so scream out your area code.. I'm comin' all the way. live from the 310!. I gotta whole lot of love. but none like you.. You make me wanna stay. here in heaven with you.. I'll write your name in the sand,. put your hand with mine.. Come on baby,. shoot your gun in the sky!. . I met her at a backyard. blockparty by the bar..

Bang bang baby hit me one time,. two days on the road. and you're still on my mind.. You'd think that I would learn. 'cause I'm young and fine. But I'm broke, so I'm tryin' to make. a hustle out of rhyme.. I gotta see the world one girl at a time,. but you're hangin' on my sleeve. like I care that you're cryin'. and I do. I'm just tryin' to play it cool. I got a rep to protect,. down at the high school.. Why you tryin' to cage me in. and when I leave we both know. that you'll be pagin' him. and when I come back. we gonn' do it again.. I promise we gonn' do it again.. .

Babies change,. they start showin' them thangs. tryin' to take a ride on. those crazy trains.. Choo choo.. What the hell am I to do?. I got a girl in every city. from here to Peru.. When I left you,. I saw my name on your left boob. now go get that tattoed,. I'll be back soon.. Don't cry, I'll bless you. with a text soon.. I gotta go, but I'll. be back next June.. Or July. Sparks in the sky..

Do it over again, and let's sing it right this time... . ps: Come early to this joint, or you'll regret it. Stick to the common dumplings and don't go with the vegetarian option, I did. Be ready to spend and it's worthed it.
