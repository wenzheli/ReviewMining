Now, I know why the line is always soooo damn long to eat here!! . . This is probably one of the best breakfast spots Ive ever been too. If I could, I would eat here everyday! They're menu is a lil overwhelming.. good overwhelming. It just means they have so many options. And let me tell you - they are all YUMMY (not that Ive had everything, but I have sampled quite a few dishes). Its soooo hard to decide sometimes. But whatever you pick- ya cant go wrong. You can get something sweet, savory, rich, light, anything and everything. Down right "make your tummy happy" food! . . The service is awesome, the decor its really cool too. And its a lot bigger than you would think. Added plus is there are lots of booths - so that's a good thing for booth lovers , like me.
