Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s
Category: Pizza
The pizza at Giordano's is very good.  Deep dish is the only way to go.  They should remove thin crust from the menu to force all customers to choose deep dish.. . We went here last Sunday with a group of 17.  Initially the wait seemed insurmountable, but they encourage you to submit your pizza order while you are waiting so your ZA can be ready when you are seated.  I think it only took us 50 minutes to be seated.  Then we still waited another 40 minutes or so for the pizzas.  But the pizza was great.  I wish I were eating it right now.  We ordered the spinach pizza (which I didn't try, but it received many thumbs up from my party), the special or supreme (which I did try and it was excellent), the pepperoni (which was also delish) and cheese (which had to be good, its a deep dish of cheese and sauce).  . . The fact that this place received 4 stars and we waited over an hour and a half to have our first bite of ZA says enough.. . BTW, what is up with all the revolving doors in Chicago.  They just upset me.  Its like those metering lights to get on the highway, but for a restaurant.  Just weird, especially when you pack 20 people in a waiting room just beyond the revolving deathtrap.
