Restaurant: Opart Thai House Restaurant
Category: Thai
I have been to Opart Thai multiple times...predominantly dates or for dinner with a friend.  Of all the thai places in this area (and there are A LOT) I feel this is one is the best.  First and foremost the food is freshly prepared and always tastes delicious.  Careful if you order spicy...because they do not hold back!  Outside of the food, the service is great and the decor is extremely welcoming.  The dark wood interior sets a comfortable mood and the division of the dining area gives a very intimate feel, even though the space is quite large.  Just for kicks, a couple of my favorites are the peanut spring roll appetizer and the Woon Sen Pad Thai.  Oh, almost forgot the best part....it is BYOB!
