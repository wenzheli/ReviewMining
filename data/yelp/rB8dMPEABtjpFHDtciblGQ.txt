Restaurant: Milk &amp; Honey Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
If you're okay with not much legroom and a little bit of noise, the breakfast/brunch at Milk and Honey will do you fine. The food is so yummy and the portions so generous I almost hate to complain about the setup and the service. . . I've eaten here several times - most recently, when dear hubby took grandma, the kidlet and me out for Mother's Day brunch.  Everyone at our table was delighted with his or her food: my husband and his bagels-and-lox, Grandma and the huevos rancheros casserole, and the kiddo ate up all of her eggs and sausage. M&amp;H's orange brioche French toast -- my personal fave -- is moist without being all like I HAS MILK AND EGGS LET ME SHOW YOU IT,  and it is ever so fluffy. . . All that said, the scene there on the weekends is kind of nuts. The tables are very close together and you have to stand in line to place your order. If you're seated near said line while you eat, you run the risk of getting elbowed and your food gawked at  - a HUGE pet peeve of mine. It's a jostle to get to the restroom, and woe is the customer who has an extra bag or a stroller because there is seriously like nowhere to put them. The restaurant has high chairs but otherwise M&amp;H may be too noisy and crowded for the more active child.
