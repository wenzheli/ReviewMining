Restaurant: Glenn&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
We stopped in at 11 for an early lunch, skipped the breakfast and got sandwiches.  By eating lunch instead of breakfast it was also completely reasonable to order alcohol, and we were definitely impressed by their offerings.. . I started with a mimosa, which came as a glass with a bit of triple sec and a sugar-coated rim, a separate glass of fresh-tasting orange juice and a tiny bottle of brut to mix yourself.  Quantities were perfect for the International Bartender Association's mandated half-and-half.  Also at the table was a Bloody Mary served with a skewer of cocktail shrimp in-glass, taking Glenn's reputation for seafood to heart.  Definitely a great way to start.. . As my profile might indicate, a weakness of mine is avocados and I went with the chicken breast sandwich and added avocado.  The sandwich was as impeccable as chicken sandwiches get.  Loaded with chicken, provolone, leaf lettuce, mayo, bacon, the aforementioned avocados and some delicious, pungent red onions, the grilled Texas toast was strong enough to keep the entire sandwich together through the last bite.  Also at the table was the Tiger shrimp Po' Boy and Montrose Avenue Lobster Roll.  The Po' Boy was all you could ask for in a Po' Boy, and the Lobster roll was average.  They definitely couldn't stand up to the power of the chicken and avocado, and everybody else at the table agreed.. . I'm only withholding 5 stars due to the average quality of the Lobster Roll, as seafood is their specialty.  I can definitely say I'll be headed back for a hearty diner breakfast or seafood dinner in the future to see if they can claim their fifth star.
