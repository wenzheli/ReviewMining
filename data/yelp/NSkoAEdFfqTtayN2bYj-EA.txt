Food is great and the portions are huge. The inside is georgous! . I've had the Shepard's Pie and the Pot Pie. Great servers.. . My biggest complaint is that guinness shouldn't be $7.50 ... seriously.. AND I went there on St. Patrick's day and they played a couple of Irish songs. The second time I went there it was just blaring spice girls music when the place was half empty.
