This is part 1 of my tentatively titled two-part series, "Mediocre Duck Tales" (haha, lol, rofl, steamlollers) . . I had high hopes for this joint and I'd been wanting to try it for awhile.  Sadly, it was just ok.  We went on a busy Friday night and had to wait for a table.  No biggie, we'll saddle up to the bar.  Guess what?  The bartender makes some strong drinks, heavy on the alcohol.  Just the way  it should be.. . Now onto the meal.  I went with the duck (blackened duck to be exact), and it was mediocre.  It was served over a portobello mushroom sauce, but for a dish that should've been bursting with flavor it was somewhat lacking.  The jalapeno mashed potatoes had a great spice to it, and that amplified the lack of taste in the duck.  This issue, however, did not prevent me from polishing off the entire plate.  . . We started with the grilled calamari for our app and it was the highlight.  Served with roasted red pepper sauce and goat cheese, it was superb.  I wish they'd make a bigger plate of this for us savages!. . It was loud.  Not to the point of screaming, but definitely loud.  I will visit again and try other things on the menu, as they looked very promising.  In the end, you dashed my hopes for duck success, Cafe 28. . . Launchpad McQuack is off to his next duck destination for part 2...
