I went to brunch this weekend at Zed451 and had an amazing experience.  The atmosphere is fantastic, the staff is upbeat and the food was incredible.  All of the dishes on the Harvest Table were served with different kinds of sauces- you can tell the chef puts a lot of thought into the food and the dining experience.  We also had a few of their specialty cocktails- delicious!  I can't wait to go one evening after work or check out their roofdeck in the summertime!
