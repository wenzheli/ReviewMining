Category: Cuban
My husband and I went for lunch yesterday.  The place was packed with happy people and the owners were fantastically friendly.  Made suggestions, were walking around the place to see if we liked everything .  I loved the atmosphere and this place is set apart from all the rest because of the owners ....and the fantastic food.  We tried the cubano and the pork sandwich which had a fried plantain on it....both super delicious!! I loved dipping them into the home-made chilli sauce!. . Will be back soon!!
