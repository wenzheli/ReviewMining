Restaurant: Gino&#39;s East
Category: Pizza
Definitely not "worth the wait"!!!. . We went here while in town for a trade show. We had the choice between Gino's and Giordano's -- in retrospect we should have chosen Giordano's.. . The atmosphere was nice, we sat at the bar and the bartender was great.. . When we sat down we asked how long the wait was, he replied "45 minutes" but quickly followed, "I'd order an appetizer to hold you over during the wait." The appetizer wasn't anything to brag about, but we waited, and waited, and waited. While sitting there waiting for our pizza I noticed the wall above the bar had a big clock with a slogan that read, "Worth the Wait", nothing could be further from the truth.. . The pizza's toppings were good, but didn't stand out to me as anything special. The crust was like cornbread that crumbled when I tried to break it apart.. . To top it all off, after 1 pop, 1 appetizer, a small 10" pizza and a 45 minute wait, they handed us a bill for $43.. . I will not go back again, and after tasting some Giordano's, I'm convinced they're the premiere pizzeria in Chicago.
