Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Oh Chicago, how I yearn for thee. Thy glorious skyscrapers and massive delicious pizzas. In October last year, I ran 13 blocks in pouring rain to this Lou's, an hour after landing in from Austin. I couldn't get here fast enough. It didn't even bother me that I had ruined my shoes, and trust me, I love my shoes. I sat dripping wet in a booth, shoes off, shivering, devouring pizza without a care in the world. Lou's is seriously the best in Chicagoland, trust this former Napervillian. I crave it on hot summer days, here in Texas, miles and miles away. I can almost smell it in the air on a crisp fall day. The butter crust, the toppings, the stewed tomato chunks. Sigh. Until next time Lou's. Kisses!
