I went here for a friend's birthday party. We had the room in the back all to ourselves, which included a door to the patio for the smokers. It was a rather large party so there wasn't much seating, but given dynamics of the party, this was not an issue.. . The service was perfect, fresh tapas seemed to be brought out just as you started to think about another tasty morsel. My favorite was the patatas bravas, basically fried potatoes with a hot and spicy cream sauce. The pinchos morunos were also very good (lamb meat balls). . . I also enjoyed my fair share of Sangria, although be forewarned, that some of fruit in the glass is orange with the rind still on (aka, don't eat it).. . I would definitely go back with a group of people, the front room seemed to be quite lively.
