Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
My wife and I have come here for years.  I wouldn't say its the best place to come to in term of ambiance, but for a quick hitter of a meal (Italian) and at cheap prices, this place is really good.  Year after year, we'd come here pre-marathon to load on carbs...and I expect, that as long as we live in the city, we'll still frequent this place.
