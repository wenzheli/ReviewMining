Why am I just trying this place now?  This is especially tragic because from the reviews I scanned, it used to be even better prior to it's Check Please fame.  I still completely enjoyed my experience here.  I'll sum up my experience here with just one thing:  the lamb soup came with two mini unexpected pieces of za'atar.  Who can find fault in a place that serves surprise za'atar?  I want to eat this right now!
