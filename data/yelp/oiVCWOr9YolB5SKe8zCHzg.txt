This was once of the best meals I have ever had in my life.  Service was top notch, presentation was incredible and the food was amazing.  They really wow you here.  One course was a caviar staircase that was delicious and I'm not even a fan of caviar.  Loved the beta fish swimming in the glass bowl under the tuna tar tare!  Truly a dining event to experience.  I can't wait to make a special trip to this city just to dine here again.  Tru is one of my favorite restaurants in the country.  Keep up the good work!
