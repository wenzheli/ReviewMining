Oh, Wakamono.. . I hate do to it.  Really, I do.. . But, I'm downgrading you one star.  *sigh*. . Nadina D. decided she wanted to have her birthday dinner here.  Yes, there were 11 of us.  Yes, Wakamono is small and ALWAYS crowded.  But, c'mon. They told us the wait would be '10 minutes' at 7:30.  But, 10 minutes passed and another 10 minutes passed....Yeah, we were seated an HOUR later.  . . They originally told us that we could be seated at the two larger tables by the windows, but....clearly, that didn't happen.  They claimed that our entire party wasn't there, even though we all were!  So, instead, they sat people that were waiting significantly less than us.  Shady.. . Waitresses here are generally surly.  That hasn't changed.  Plus, they didn't give us menus until we were seated for like 10 minutes.  But, they did make a nice gesture and gave our entire party glasses of champagne - on the house.  . . Food is good, though, as always.  The Fire Dragon and the Mango maki (both $12) are really good.  Plus, they gave us each a separate plate with our respective orders...so, that was nice.  But, not nice enough to make up for the bitchiness earlier in the night.  The hostesses really need to get a clue!. . So, please don't consider coming to Wakamono is you have a big group.  You'll just give yourself and your party huge headaches.  A max of 4 people is best. . . BYOB - $5 fee/bottle.
