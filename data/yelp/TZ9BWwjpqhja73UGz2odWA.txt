Restaurant: Gino&#39;s East
Category: Pizza
This was my favorite place for pizza, when I came to Chicago twelve years ago, this place was all I dreamed about. And I would wait in that long line, in the freezing cold for an hour or more just to eat the great great pizza.. . Alas, no more. Because, and I don't mean to be quick to judge because I've done my repeat patronage, no longer is Gino's up to par. I have taken several family and friends to Gino's over the past couple of months, because they remember how good it was. And every time, all I could do was wince, the recipe has changed, the sauce is not the original sauce, and the cheese is lacking. I kept my mouth shut about how I felt to not influence anyones judgement, and family and friends offered up the same conclusion....isn't as good as it used to be. . . The place is still decorated great, the staff super friendly, but the pizza is not worth the wait anymore. The only thing that felt the same was the sausage, but everything else screams for help. . . I used to make fun of people who deemed Lou Malnati's as the best pizza, because I was always quick to correct them and stand by Gino's. But now, I take it back, Lou's is better now and from this day forward I will only go there. . . Gino's is nothing more than a tourist trap now. IF you want good pizza, pass up Gino's.
