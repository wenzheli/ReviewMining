I live nearby, but had never been before.  I went for Sunday brunch and was pleasantly surprised.  I can't comment on dinners, but the brunch was AMAZING!  You get all-you-can eat buffet area, plus they still do the walking around with the meat thing - although they don't come around with the beef very often.  The buffet area was, frankly, wonderful - I would have paid the fee just for that.  Service was attentive and friendly - I will definitely be back for other brunches.
