I had some time to kill while i was waiting for my room in the Hyatt to be prepared, so I decided to go next door and get some of this "world famous" pizza I've always heard about.  Well the deep dish lived up to the slice.  I got the sausage, pepperoni, and jalapeno stuffed deep dish, and it was incredible.  Just a word of caution, give yourself some time to order and eat because it takes about 35-45 mins to make each one.. . While I was waiting I had some local beers on tap and they were excellent.  My bartender Marcee was the best.  She kept me company and my glass full the entire time i was there...which ended up being around 3 hours. Hey what can I say, once the drinks start flowing right...lol.  . When you go to Chicago, you should definitely give this a shoot, you won't be disappointed.  FYI, go during lunch time, it's the only time they offer the individual pizza and it's way cheaper.
