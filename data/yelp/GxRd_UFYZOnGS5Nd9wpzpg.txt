This place is awesome! . . First off I am in love with the coffee, if you want a great cup of coffee go to this place. When you walk in it doesn't look like much and unless your choice of seating is a bar stool its not the most comfortable setting to enjoy their delicious food. So get your food to go and order one of their Cuban sandwiches you will not be disappointed. I have also tried their bread pudding and it is some of the best I've had. PLEASE check this place out, a few bucks gets you a long way here.
