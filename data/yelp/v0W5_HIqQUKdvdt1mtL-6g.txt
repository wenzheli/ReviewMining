Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
The Pho here - Five stars, hands down.  Best Pho broth I've had in Chicago. Wow wow wow. I can't stop thinking about it. Yummmmmm.  . . The service - one star!  Okay, I'm Asian so I understand what bad customer service is, but Tank took it to a level even I was uncomfortable with.  Wow, the service made me want to never go there again, but the Pho is so good that I am sure to be back.
