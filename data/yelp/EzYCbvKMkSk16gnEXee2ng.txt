Category: Greek
YUM!. . So Greek Islands Restaurant is pretty smart - Free valet?  I'm there!  And I'm sure there are plenty of other people who are in this boat too.  I was the first to arrive in my party and our host was very friendly and accomodating.. . Per my fellow yelp'ers recs, we tried the flaming saganaki.  You will not be let down.  The presentation is pretty awesome.  Anything flambe will fascinate me.  I was served a greek salad that I found addictive.  Those simple salad dressings really get me!. .  I ordered the shrimp tourkolimano and it was delicioso!  The marinara sauce was delectable and complimented the shrimp quite well.  My cohorts ordered the mousaka, grilled octopus, and roasted lamb; we are very pleased with our dishes.. . Not sure of when I would return - solely because I pride myself in finding cheap eat treasures and Greek Islands, although not expensive, is certainly not cheap.  They do, however, get high marks from me =)
