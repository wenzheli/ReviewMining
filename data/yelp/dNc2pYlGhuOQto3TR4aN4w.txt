Restaurant: Yolk
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Yolk is my favorite breakfast / brunch restaurant in Chicago. I love it. There's a reason why you see long lines out front every weekend. It's great. Maybe I'm just lucky, but whenever I've been to Yolk, I either get seated immediately or a few short moments later. That said, don't be intimidated if you encounter long lines when you visit. The tables sometimes free up pretty quickly.. . The food is heavenly and I love that you get your money's worth when you come. Portions are generous and most entrees come with sides. My personal favorites are the West Coast Crepes, Fruit and Nut Pancakes, and the Tuscan Frittata. They also have really yummy orange juice (or strawberry orange juice if you dare!) which explains their excellent mimosas.. . Love it, love it, love it! Hopefully, you will too. :)
