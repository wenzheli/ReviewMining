I think it is time I edit my previous post! I went there few weeks ago and definitely noticed a big improvement since they have started.   Service was good to start with (i guess because we were there at 10am) and noticed that as the place got busier, we had to make sure to get hold of our waiter or else we would be just waiting to get our check.... . I think they have just too much on their menu - it feels like data overload and you just don't want that on Saturday mornings! . . Overall the food is good, how wrong can one go when making omelette's! I miss the Orange on Harrison which has been closed! Since south loop has few options for breakfast food - Yolk is worth going to! I recommend to go there around 10am or earlier on weekends, because after that it gets way busy, loud and annoying!
