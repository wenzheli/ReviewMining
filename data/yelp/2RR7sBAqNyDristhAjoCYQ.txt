This place is a brunch factory.  Both the cavernous space and expressionless waitstaff are devoid of personality.  They have a PA system for the host to call the next party, and there is a large, bare area at the front JUST for people to stand and wait.  The food was decent, but pretty plain.  Why do people flock here?  Just because it's the only brunch joint within a 1.5-mile radius?  I guess that somebody has to feed all those 20- and 30-something South Loopers after Friday and Saturday nights' revels.. . I got a Texas fajita omelette:  eggs, cheddar, diced chicken, onions, green peppers:  enjoyable but not special.  I will say that the fruit (cantaloupe, pineapple, orange slices, and watermelon) was very fresh and good.  Also, the cinnamon roll was, while on the drier side, very tasty as well, with a non-sugary buttercream icing.  I liked the pecan sticky bun too, despite its dryness.  (Yeah, I got the sticky bun to go but I ate it a half-hour later because I have no self-control. [sad face]). . Our waitress was AWOL most of the time, as my water glass sat there as bone-dry as my poor parched throat.  Sometimes we take table water for granted, but in the summer, man, I NEED that stuff.
