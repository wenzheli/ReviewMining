Had the shrimp spring rolls, which were great, but nothing to write home about.  Comparable to most vietnamese spring rolls. I guess, it's safe to say that I haven't had a bad one YET.  First time having the vietnamese crepe with shrimp.  Very tasty, had a great crunch but a little bit too much bean sprouts.  . . the mango bubble tea was some of the best I've ever had.  It tasted fresh, and not chalky from any added flavoring.  Drink came with slices of mango AND watermelon, as well as the tapioca on the bottom.  YUM. . Now onto the pho.  Had the beef pho with skirt steak.  Ahhh, this broth was heavely.  The noddles were not overly gooey, just the right al dente consistency you expect from pho.  The best pho I've had with pho from Hoanh Long coming in on a close second.. . I am removing a star becuase their service wasn't the best.  But forgiveable for best pho. . Would recommend to try Tank.  I would love to try all the pho places at Argle to see really who has the best
