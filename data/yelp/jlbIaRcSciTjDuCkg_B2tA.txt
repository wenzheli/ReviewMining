Restaurant: Calo Ristorante
Category: Pizza
I remember eating at Calo pre-rehab.  It certainly has a different feel then, than it did "back in the day".. . The food here is certainly consistent and we probably order take-out once a week.  We ate here on Saturday evening and we all enjoyed our meals.. . The closeness to home makes it very convenient and we have never had any complaints.  One thing I feel really defines a place is each consistency.  I hate ordering a pizza and wondering what pizza I was going to get.  Sauce is always the same as well as the ingredients which is why we go back.
