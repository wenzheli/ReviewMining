A mojito please! Usually, this drink is made by muddling mint and sugar with a splash of soda water in a glass. Normally, you muddle until the sugar dissolves and you can smell the mint. Then, you squeeze the lime into the glass, add rum, and shake with ice; strain over ice. Top with soda water. Sounds delicious, right? This is a real Cuban delight, well, if prepared properly. . . The bartender seemed a bit slammed. Understandable on a Friday night at 8:45. I don't mind to wait an extra minute for my drink, to have it prepared properly. Not an option tonight! The sugar hasn't dissolved, mint not muddled, and drink not shaken. Bummer. My hubby tries a margarita and it's quite dreary. At close to $9 each we had hoped for more. We polish off both beverages and continue to wait for a table. He opts to try a beer this time and me being the guinea pig I set myself up to be: I try one more mixed drink. It leaves a lot to be desired AND our name is called! Yay! No more throwing money to the wind. . . We sit down. We are confronted by an attractive, but not so friendly waiter. He is rather curt and doesn't seem all that excited to see us. Oh well, ultimately, we are here for the food, not the drinks or the service. The bread is quickly delivered with amazing jalapeno butter. Water glasses are constantly filled. Appetizer is up and the dirty plates are cleared and before you know it dinner is served. The staff is wonderful and very efficient (with the exception of the bartender and waiter). Haha. The food is cooked to perfection. Tender juicy meat filling your mouth with flavor. The combinations are paired perfectly. We wish the drinks and service could have impressed us as much as the food!
