Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
The pho here is ok, not mindblowing, but it's fine on a cold winter day.  I admit that the broth is a bit bland.  But the noodles are never overcooked and they offer culantro along with the bean sprouts, lime, basil, and jalapenos.. . I prefer ordering their grilled beef banh mi.  It's simply grilled beef sandwich with jalapenos, cilantro, and pickled carrots &amp; radish.  They don't include mayo or pate in this particular sandwich, but it's actually better that way.  And I usually order their pork chop, Chinese sausage, and fried egg combo meal, which is really tasty (especially with a drizzle of Sriracha on everything).  It comes with a sweet dipping sauce and a small bowl of broth (forget the broth - it's bland).. . They do have an *interesting* selection of music at times, so be careful where you sit.  Last time we sat under the speakers and had to endure Britney Spears and Rihanna over and over again.
