This is one place that will always remain a staple in my book of cheap eats! . . They have tons of menu choices but they will always be known for their barbeque selections. . . When I dine in with my friends I never have to spend more than $6 at the most :) Because I simply order the rice plates :) . . Each plate is a mountain full of steamed rice piled with your selection of roasted/ barbeque meat. You can choose from a range of roast pork, bbq pork, roast duck, soy chicken, bbq ribs and a few more tasty meat choices. Plus it has a side of steamed veg and half a slice of salted egg too which is a nice accompaniment to the meal. . . Did I mention that its a mountain of food? For people who have moderate appetites, it can be good for 2 meals. But of course for me, why go over the trouble of bringing home a doggy bag when you can eat your nice meal right there. . . A lot of people can get mesmerized by the fancy dishes in this place, such as the $30 duck platter. Trust me, go for the $5 duck over rice, its the same duck which is a generous portion for one and you save more :) . . If you're in the mood for some soup, the shrimp wonton soup is absolutely the bomb! Generous sized wontons filled with ground pork and a nice plump shrimp is served over noodles and a tasty broth. And yes, its less than $5.  . . O yeah! before I forget, don't forget they sell their bbq/ roasted goodies to go! (Plus its a few bucks cheaper than the dine-in menu) this is a good place to grab a quick take out for company at home. My absolute favorite will always be the roast pork and duck!
