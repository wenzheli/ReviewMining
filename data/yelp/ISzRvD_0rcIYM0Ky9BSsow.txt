Well, I guess it's happening; we couldn't get in for happy hour tonight.... . We used to order delivery a lot from here, and it varied wildly, probably depending on how long the sushi had to sit in a car.... . But the food has always tasted great when we dined in. We've been going to happy hour once a week for a little while now, not forever but long enough to become attached to our new tradition!. . The environment is wacky, for sure, but I like it. Not snooty at all. For some reason there have been babies making a racket in there every time we've gone, but I don't think you can blame them for that, can you?. . The only think I wish is that they had nigiri or sashimi, but I know that's their thing, and I'm not really complaining about it.... . Crazy "white-boy" rolls as the husband calls them, very creative and delicious.
