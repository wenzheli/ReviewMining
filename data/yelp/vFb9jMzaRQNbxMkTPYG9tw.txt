After months of anticipation, we finally came to this restaurant, which smelt wonderful outside. We ordered. . melanzane - yummy eggplants!. fritti del giorno - really good fried fennel. . diavola - salty. salsiccia - very good. biano nero - very good. . I really enjoyed their pizza due to fresh ingredients and the lightness of the dough. I will come back!
