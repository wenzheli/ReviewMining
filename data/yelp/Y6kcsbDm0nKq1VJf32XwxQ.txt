Restaurant: Indie Cafe Thai &amp; Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
I miss this place. So. Much. . . Prior to being the Indie Cafe, there were several other restaurants in this location, none of which stayed open for long. I think all of Edgewater rejoiced when Indie opened its doors and we found really great food there. It's awesome that they're still open, and they've even expanded.. . Indie has proven time and again that good sushi doesn't have to be expensive (or pretentious). The Thai options are excellent as well. I am always amazed at the beautiful way they plate the food, because you feel like you're in a super swanky restaurant and should be paying way more than you are. To make it even better, it's BYOB.. . Great food, and great value for the money. Go here now.
