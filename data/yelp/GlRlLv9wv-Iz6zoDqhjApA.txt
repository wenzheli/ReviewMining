Restaurant: Gino&#39;s East
Category: Pizza
I cannot believe people actually directed me to Gino's.  What?. . I don't know what it is that I put in my mouth but I never want to put it in there again!  The crust was SO dry and crumbly, and although I asked for a plain cheese pizza, they managed to pile on about 5 layers of pepperoni.  Great.  Just what I asked for.. . Service was fine, and there was ample seating but thank God I ordered a side salad.  Or else I would have gone hungry.. . There must be better deep dish in this city.... . Stay tuned...
