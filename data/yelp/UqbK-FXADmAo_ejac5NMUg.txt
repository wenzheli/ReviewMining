In the words of Homer Simpson.....mmmmmmmm.......... . Dang, this was some tasty pizza. If you are looking for deep dish or chicago style, go elsewhere. This is for thin crust traditional style Italian pizza, and it is so good. . . here's what i ate. . Wine - Greco something or other. I'm not a wine connoisseur, but this went down very easily. . . Pizza - Buffalo motzerealla with arugula. It was some of the finest ever. I don't know if it was the olive oil they drizzled on it, or if it was the tasty oil from the cheese, but there was some kind of oil on it that really made it wonderful. . . Dessert - baked ricotta. Was good, but i wouldn't get it again after tasting the chocolate thing that my husband ate. I can't remember what it was called, but it was like a combination of chocolate ice cream and chocolate mouse in a wonderful chocolatly goodness wonder. . . The food came out so quick, so it wasn't really a great place if you are looking to linger, but it was GREAT!
