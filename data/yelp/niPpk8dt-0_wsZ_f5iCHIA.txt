Getting out of Trotter's a bit later than expected I said goodbye to my pal and hopped into the waiting car on Armitage.  I quickly flipped open my cellphone and placed a call...we were going to be late.  "Not a problem" said the voice on the other end, "we'll see you soon."  ...and what did you do after the grand tasting and an extra dessert at Charlie Trotter's, sir?  I went to TRU with the 3 most important people in my life for the dessert tasting menu - that is what I did.. . Arriving at TRU a short man in a suit took our car while another held open the door - "You made it, please have a seat in the lounge while we prepare your table" said the hostess.  5 minutes passed and another man appeared to escort us to our table in the main dining room; chairs were pulled out for the ladies and purse-stools impressed my mother and sister while the synchronized pouring of water caused me to chuckle.  Napkins - white or black, your choice - were handed out with tongs - menus too were passed out in-synch.  Call it contrived, call it unnecessary - I call it an unsurpassed and impressive level of service...especially since this level continued throughout the entire 2 hour experience.  Orders were placed - 4 dessert tastings, 3 coffees - and we were off.. .
