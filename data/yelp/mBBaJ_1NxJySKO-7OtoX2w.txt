Ordered delivery from here the other day.  Although a bit expensive, the food was wonderful.. This is a perfect place for people who don't like sushi to try some new stuff.  The honey sushi was insanely good and the spicy tuna roll was perfect (some places like to make it so hot that you can't enjoy it).. This is not a traditional sushi joint.  They are proud to put their own twist on sushi and it works.  Very tasty and satisfying, I'd order from here again and will probably head in to enjoy the restaurant itself.. A bit pricey, I'd spend the extra dough over, say, Kamehachi because the quality and care is so much better.. Very enjoyable.  Recommended!
