I love this place.  Great combination of Japanese and Thai food.  I must admit my guilt pleasure is complimentary food.  I occasionally get cravings for different types of food at the same time.  (For example, Tacos and Pizza, Wings and Sushi, - Call me weird for that one) . . Back to the review...their special Maki is great, their soft shell crab maki fantastic.  All the traditional Thai dishes are fantastic too.  Their Drunken Noodle has a nice spice to it.  . . My wallet slim because of Indie Cafe Thai &amp; Sushi.
