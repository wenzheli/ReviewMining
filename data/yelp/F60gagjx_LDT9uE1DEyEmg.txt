Restaurant: Tom&#39;s
Category: Diners
Tom's has the best atmosphere of any diner in Brooklyn- but the food is really sub-par, as much as I hate to say it. Get the pancakes.Don't drink the coffee.. . It's a great early am destination for families on Saturdays- but by 9am it's packed. Closed on Sundays.
