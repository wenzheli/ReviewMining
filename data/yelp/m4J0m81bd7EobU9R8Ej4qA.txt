Restaurant: 90 Miles Cuban Café
Category: Cuban
Amazing sandwiches, empanadas, and tamales!  Wash it all down with a cafe cubano and you'll be a full and happy for the rest of the day.  Even better- the owners are super nice- when this place was still being built we stopped by thinking it was open and got a tour and menu.  90 miles is a great alternative to the overpriced and impersonal environment of Cafe 28.  I stop by once a week before a long shift at CVES next door and am never disappointed!
