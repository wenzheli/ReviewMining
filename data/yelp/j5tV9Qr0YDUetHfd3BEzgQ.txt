Restaurant: Las Tablas Colombian Steakhouse
Category: Latin American
this place is all about the timing. . . off days are better days as weekends turn the place into another street fest circus with loud music, loud , loud conversations, high cockage fees, and diminished elbow room as people try to squeeze in to taste the marinated meats. . . its good, chimichurri is okays, not spectacular or heavily spiced, but doesn't get in the way of the meat which is key.. . come hungry, bring friends and get your meat on.. . plenty of paybox street parking, lots of cab activity and a short walk to the sopo cta and bars.
