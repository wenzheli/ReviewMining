If I'm not feeling up to the insane waits at Toast, I come during the later hours of the afternoon, and the wait isn't AS insane, also, there's more room than most other brunchy places in Chi, so it makes it a great place for groups larger than 3!!. . I loooove the decor and I love the HUMONGOUS array of options- it's hot, it's fresh, and I've never had bad service here.... . I really, really recommend their Santa Fe omelet and toast with salsa on it. Plus, their hot chocolate is great!. . And, if you can finagle it, their booths are great to sit at.. . Oh, and they're greaaat about splitting credit card charges, so feel free to go with large groups!. . As a final word: what makes this place better than the other places is the lack of attitude- the service is pleasant, the menu isn't rude (*ahem* Orange!), and they're great about dietary restrictions and customizations. I always leave satisfied.
