Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
After dining here (and at Uno a few months ago outside of Chicago), I realized that I'm not a fan for deep dish pizzas. I'm simply too stuffed after just one slice and I can't distinguish what's good/bad because it's loaded with cheese. I do know that Giordano's dough is less greasy and less crispy than Uno's.. . This place seems to be always busy, and takes forever to take my order, takes forever to make the pizza, and takes forever to get me my tab. Bleh.
