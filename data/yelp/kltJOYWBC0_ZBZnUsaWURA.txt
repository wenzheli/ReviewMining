Restaurant: Buttermilk Channel
Category: American (New)
I had a wonderfully mellow brunch here on an otherwise dreary December Sunday.  My companion and I arrived at 10am on the dot to a wisp of a line and were shortly welcomed inside and seated by the charming staff.  By the time our orders arrived, the place seemed more a less full, but not overly noisy.. . My pecan pie french toast was perfectly sweet (not saccharine) with a warm wink of burbon flavor running through its syrup bath.  My brunch-mate found her "short stack" of buttermilk pancakes to be a bit taller than she expected, but delicious. We split some sausage patties which were savory and unexpectedly colorful.. . Over all an absolutely satisfying ... and affordable ... experience.  Their entire menu was enticing, so I'm sure to be charting a course to the Channel again sometime soon.
