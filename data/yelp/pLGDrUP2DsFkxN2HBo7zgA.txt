I love this place.. . I've only tried the savory crepes, but I can't wait to get back and try the banana Nutella. Mmmm.... . The crepes are light and delicious. They have a ton of varieties to order or you can build your own. I LOVE the Icosium crepe: roasted peppers, onions, garlic, spinach, arrugula, tomatoes, goat cheese and pine nuts. I like to add in the Algerian lamb sausage. *sigh* So delicious. On different occasions my dining companions have ordered: the brie/apple crepe and build your own. Both were tasty. Oooh! And we started with their veggie puree soup, I finished the whole bowl!! P.S. both soup options were vegetarian. Mark this one as a good place to take your non-carnivore pals.. . The Turkish coffee with cardamom is fantastic as well.. . It's a super cute place, I love the decor. When I visited most recently, Caitlin was our server and she seriously rocked. Some of the most exceptional service I've had in a long time.
