My husband took me here for our first date, so this place has always held a special place in my heart. I've been back many times since then and have always had a good experience. The best is brunch in the Summer -- their outdoor patio in back is perfect on a sunny day. I just returned from lunch with co-workers and it was a hit with them too. GREAT mojitos. The Taste of Cuba appetizer is a nice sampling of various Cuban treats. The Ropa Vieja (shredded flank steak) is always a hit. Great decor, the servers are very nice, and a great location! It's a "sure thing" for a first date, or a gathering with friends/family. Aw, hell, it's a sure thing for any occasion. :-)
