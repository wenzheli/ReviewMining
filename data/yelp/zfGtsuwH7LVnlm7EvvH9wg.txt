Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
So is this what all the fuss is about?  Got to admit, it's very good deep dish pizza but I have had better, in San Francisco of all places (Patxis) but I guess that's beside the point.  I had the Lou, the crust was buttery and soft and the prices were just right - a small will feed two.  Personally, I was more impressed with the the stuffed spinach bread, I totally recommend it but be warned, it's very filling (and buttery and cheesy and yummy)!  The wine selection sucks but I guess that's to be expected (why I asked for wine at a pizzeria was a just a dumb move on my part!).  So yeah, overall it's a fine place but I'm guessing there's a better place for Chicago style pizza, hmmm...
