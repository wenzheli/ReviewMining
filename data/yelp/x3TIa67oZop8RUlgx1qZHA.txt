Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
I'd give Tank 5 stars but i haven't been in Chi-town long enough to say that it is mos def THE BEST noodle house. For the week that i've been here, i will say that it is the most satisfying meal i've had in a looong time. . . The ambience is chill, with easy listening favorites similar to Cali tunes from the mid-90s [ya know, the songs you don't really want to admit to knowing the words to but LOVE singing behind closed doors]. . The Service is prompt and friendly, and the food, ABSOLUTELY De-lish! I had the fish noodle soup - you can tell they put time and lotsa flavor into the broth + the claypot catfish - the flesh slid off the meat and literally melted in your mouth. . . Take it from the Asian, this is a MUST visit!
