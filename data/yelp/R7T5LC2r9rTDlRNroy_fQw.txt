When in Chicago we had to try the infamous Deep Dish Pizza. Ginos was reviewed highly and since we were staying on Michigan ave this was a place that was in our walking range.. We waited outside for about 10 minutes before we were brought inside to be seated. In total it was about 20 mintues before we were seated. We knew in advance that the deep dish would take 45 minutes so we ordered an appetizer, the garlic breadsticks. They were okay but didn't stand out, really, they were very similar to the breadsticks you get at Olive Garden. The sauce was good and really helped the case.. We ordered a small pepperoni deep dish. It was pretty good and helped us solidify our opinion that NY style is our favorite. . The service was great  and the food was okay.
