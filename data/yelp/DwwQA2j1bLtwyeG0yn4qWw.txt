Great pizza!  Not your average pizza place.  Good appetizers and definitely good desserts.  They have a decent variety of dessert wines; nonetheless it is a pizza place.  When you are in need of just good pizza and something to top it off but you want something more than a take out box left after the meal, like oh I don't know a great feeling of satisfaction of having had a gourmet meal, healthy, with great ingredients but still decadent enough to boast as simply pizza, this is the place for you.  It's a small storefront place with decent seating arrangements but it definitely holds its own with the variety of wood burning oven pizza places out there.
