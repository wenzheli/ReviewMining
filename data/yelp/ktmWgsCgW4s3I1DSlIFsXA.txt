Restaurant: Glenn&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
Since yesterday was such a beautiful day my roommate and myself decided to head to Glenn's for dinner and sit out on their patio. This was my first experience at Glenn's (despite the fact that I live so close to it) and I am now a fan. I ordered a chicken salad melt and it was delicious. The chicken salad was some of the best chicken salad I've had. My roommate got the classic egg breakfast sandwich. It is not your typical breakfast sandwich. I tried a bite of it... so good... TONS of scrambled eggs with bacon and cheese, and it's on actual sliced bread (thickly sliced of course), not a bagel or English muffin... I'm pretty sure I'm trying that one next time I go. Their sandwiches are HUGE! Seriously, I could only eat half. And the potato pancakes that you can get with your sandwiches are so tasty!  The service was attentive and friendly. They have a great patio to sit out on. And did I mention that they have like 30 plus variates of cereal that you can order with a chilled bowl even, I mean, really, that's awesome! This is a great place and I will be back!
