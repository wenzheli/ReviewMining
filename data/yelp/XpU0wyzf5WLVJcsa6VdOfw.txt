Restaurant: Las Tablas Colombian Steakhouse
Category: Latin American
Favorite Chicagoland Restaurant!. . I have been going to Las Tablas for over 10 years and I absolutely love this place!  This is a must see, must taste restaurant.  My favorite dish is the "Matrimonio" ($20) which is a chicken and steak combo and quite possibly the best grilled chicken and steak I have ever tasted!  The dish comes with a baked potato, yucca, and plantains.  We also love the green "salsa-like" concoction that they put on the table.  It's super spicy and addicting!  I have been here before in groups or just my SO and me.  We've made reservations before and also walked in off the street.  The longest wait we have had on a walk-in was 15min on a weekend night.  When Las Tablas was across the street in a much smaller space I remember waiting close to an hour- it's that good!  The wait staff is friendly and attentive and you will not be disappointed!
