We go here way too often because it's right down the street from our place, but they consistently deliver great food and coffee. Some of my favorites are the huevos rancheros, egg panini, turkey reuben, and the grilled chicken sandwich on ciabatta. My wife loves the egg panini with avo instead of bacon and the avo-gouda-veggie sandwich. Get a bag of granola to bring home with you too!
