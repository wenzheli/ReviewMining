Restaurant: Alinea
Category: American (New)
I design themed immersive environments for a living and eating at Alinea is THE immersive culinary experience for your pallette.. Having lived in New York City &amp; now Los Angeles I have been lucky enough to eat at what are considered to be some of the top restaurants in the world.  Alinea is by far the most amazing meal I have ever had.. The whole experience is immersive: taste, smell &amp; sound.. I recommend adding the wine pairing to the tasting (yes much more expensive, but so worth it).. The decor is soft modern bordering on minimal. The staff are attentive without being overwhelming.. There is a great write up of Alinea in the most recent WIRED magazine.. All I have left to say is "freeze dried caramel that dissolved on our tounges".
