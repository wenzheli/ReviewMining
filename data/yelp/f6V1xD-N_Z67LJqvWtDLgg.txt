What a wonderful restaurant. Que bien!!! As we waited for our table to be ready we were promptly greeted by the very attentive bartender, Ardi was his name. His drinks were very good and he was very friendly. We continued that night with great service from our waitress, and the food was delicious. I would love to go back every week to try something new. We also had the guava cheesecake which was superb, a very latino twist on the classically New York dessert. All in all it was a wonderful restaurant with a great atmosphere and flavor. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to taste a little bit of Cuba.
