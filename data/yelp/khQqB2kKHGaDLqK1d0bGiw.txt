Came here for a friend's bday...service started out fine then got worse and worse.  First off, it took forever to get their "cowboys" or whatever you call the guys who walk around with the slabs of meat, to get to our table.  Most of the time they'd just walk by even if we had our coin flipped to "YES GIMME MEAT".  Then, we never got refills on our water NOR did anyone come clear our dirty plates.  Finally, dying of thirst, I got up, took our dirty plates to the server station and grabbed a water pitcher to refill everyone's water.  Finally seeing that someone who SHOULDNT be serving was doing their job, the server walked up and asked if we needed anything, in which i replied that it's been handled.  . . I had to clear our table twice and get water 3 times for our group, then on top of that, as we were walking out of the bar, we noticed that someone had spilled au jus ALL over the birthday girl's white sweater that was hanging on the back of her chair.  We walked to the bar hoping for some club soda or something to help get the stain out, only to be greeted by the same shitty service.  No one was at the bar and we finally had to walk around the place looking for the hostess.  That poor hostess--she was probably the only good thing at the place although inexperienced.  When we told her our complaints all she did was smile and say sorry..... the least you couldve done was taken some $$ off the bill.. . not worth going again unless you want to pay to serve yourself.
