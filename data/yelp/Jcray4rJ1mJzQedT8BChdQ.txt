If you have the money or like to save money for a meal you should go. It is really incredible. . . It only gets four stars because it's so expensive. It would get five if I could afford it more than once every five years...or when other people pay. . . The wine guy was kind of bogus too. I know the word for "wine guy" but because he was bogus I'm not going to call him by his title. . . Otherwise great experience. Great food. Wonderful presentation.
