Restaurant: Yolk
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I've been here for breakfast a couple of times now, and it is mostly wonderful.  Here's a breakdown of the breakfast at Yolk:. . Decor:  really contemporary.  Yolk feels clean and modern.  A great place to take someone from out of town who is not adventurous enough to try some of the more neighborhood spots.. . Service:  Once you get seated, it's generally passable.  See wait below.. . Wait:  REALLY REALLY LONG!  Even though the place is huge, there are scores of people bunched in the waiting area.  If they tell you an hour, expect an hour 10.  This is probably the biggest reason that I don't come back more often.. . Food:  Savory egg dishes are really pretty good.  The fritattas are amazing.  Stay away from the corned beef hash (what was I thinking with that anyway?). . Overall, I was pretty happy with Yolk.  Since Orange closed, it's among my favorite South Loop places for brunch.
