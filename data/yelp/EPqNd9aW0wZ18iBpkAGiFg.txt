Definitely the best pizza in Chicago from a pizza purist standpoint at least, being from Jersey I think am qualified to make that sort of determination.  Although I love Chicago food, I find it frustrating that it is easier to get good pizza in San Diego then it is here.. . If you like light, wood-fired, tasty fresh ingredients this is the spot.  We literally stumbled upon it about a year ago and are so glad we did.  This authentic Italian Pizza here in Chicago, not New York or Chicago style, Italian.  . . Fresh mozzarella and sauce, if the pizza has sauce, is applied in the perfect proportions to every pizza.  They have an amazing seafood antipasto and the what I think is homemade mozzarella is the best I have ever had, that includes several trips I have made to Italy. . . If you want authentic Italian Pizza without having to worry about paying "tourist" prices, navigating Roma traffic or snutting in stinky Venice air this is the spot.. . RrL
