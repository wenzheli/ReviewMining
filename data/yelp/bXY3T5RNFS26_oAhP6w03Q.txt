Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
I love this place!  It's fast and delicious pasta; plus it's really cheap.  It's a hole-in-the-wall fun type of place.  They have board games in The Other Side which is conncected if you go with a large group of people.  You can eat in either section depending on if you want a loud bar, or a slightly more quiet restaurant.. . I just wish they delivered to my neighborhood and that parking was a little easier (parking in Lincoln Park is a feat no matter where you go though).
