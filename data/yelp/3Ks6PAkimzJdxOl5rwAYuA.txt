DELICIOUS!!! You need to pretty much starve yourself all day to get your moneys worth here.  This Brazillian steak house has an extremely fun atmosphere.  I would suggest making reservations.  The salad bar is incredible.  It's huge and pretty much endless.  Word of advice: only go up to the salad bar once and try a little bit of everything.  It would be very easy to fill up on the salad bar (obviously that's what they want you to do), but I would suggest saving room for all the delicious protein that makes its way around the dining area.  The dessert is fabulous as well.  If you see something go by that you haven't gotten to try, don't be shy and ask one of the waiters to send that protein over your way.  Also, the grilled pineapple is amazing!  I would highly suggest Brazzaz.  It's very pricey, but you are definitely fulfilled after this meal!  If you don't want to hurt your wallet as much, opt for lunch!
