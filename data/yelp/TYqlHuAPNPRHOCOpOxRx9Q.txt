Went for a quick bite with a couple friends to milk and honey the other day and we had a couple bowls of some of the best soup I have had in the area.  One was a tomato with India spice and I was just in India and it was flavorful and so darn tasty.  We also enjoyed another Tomato based soup with sausage that was even better than I had hoped.  The best part was the service and since they were getting ready to close they actually gave us 3 cups of free coffee togo rather than tossing it which I thought was very nice.. . Will be back soon
