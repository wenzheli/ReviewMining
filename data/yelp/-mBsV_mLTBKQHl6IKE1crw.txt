i absolutely love this place. i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a really good brunch place. . . max and i have been here a handful of times and it has never disappointed. . . i would highly suggest the pancake special (it changes daily i believe). i am a huge pancake person and theirs are just perfect. i hate pancakes when they are very light and airy or chalky (like biscuik) and these are the exact opposite. they are very dense and just plain delicious. . . my favorite pancake combo so far was cranberry, almond, granola. these featured the famous milk and honey granola on top - which is very yummy.. . ok, maybe you're wondering if there's anything good BESIDES the pancakes. answer is yes. between max and i, we've tried the orange brioche french toast, the huevos rancheros, and the breakfast panini. all were great. of those, the breakfast panini i'd say was the least interesting. kind of just a breakfast sandwich you could make yourself. but still very good. . . and max, who's more of a savory breakfast guy would tell you the huevos rancheros are amazing. . . also, bonus: they serve intelligentsia coffee. . note: this place is very popular so expect there to be a line out the door. but don't be discouraged. it goes faster than you would think. and their hostess is great. she is very nice and super organized. she'll give you a number while you wait in line. you order at the counter and usually by the time you're done ordering or a minute or two later she has found a seat for you. longest we've waited (and we go usually at prime times - sat and sun mid morning) is about 25 min. . . bottom line - go there!
