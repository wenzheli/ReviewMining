Restaurant: Greek Islands Restaurant
Category: Greek
hands down, my favorite Greek restaurant of all time.  . . authentic Greek food, SUPERattentive wait staff that speak to one another (&amp; the clientele should they also speak the language) in Greek, and surroundings that feel and smell like your in the islands.  . . though quite touristy, my Greek friends also come here at midnight on Easter with their entire family - i'm talking 25-30 people (all of which will vouch for the food).  i have brought my friends/family here and we've always had good, good times.. . must haves: saganaki, avgolemono, dolmades, mousaka, grilled baby octopus.  for first timers, try the combination plate and/or vegetarian plate for a lil' bite of everything.. . Yes, OPA!  bring me more saganaki.
