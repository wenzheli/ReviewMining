I ate at Wilde's for my birthday, and it was delish!  Don't go if you are against food babies.  They know how to serve up the heavy.  I had the macaroni, and though I was afraid they wouldn't be able to serve it sans-bacon, they totally could, because this isn't some pre-made pop it in the microwave kind of establishment.  yum!. . I docked a star because our table was so close to the tables next to us that the waiter had to move them for me to get through to the bench to sit [and i'm friggin skinny].  And then when other patrons filled those tables, I was trapped there.  That wasn't cool.  Just take away one table and you won't have to do that dudes.  Also, the music was dance-club loud.  What is up with that?. . You should go!
