Going out on a limb and gonna say that the meal I just had at Brazzaz ranks in top 10 all-time.. this place is seriously no joke. . . The salad bar is complete with ceviche, seared tuna, bbq shrimp, crisp lettuce and insanely fresh vegetable sides including south american flavors.. this is a 2-3 trip salad bar and really could be dinner alone... . . Typical brazilian steakhouse where the servers cut dozens of cuts of meat at your table in addition to fresh pineapple, chicken breast, shrimp and cuts of sausage.. I had a bit of the few cuts and all were mouth watering... as funny as this sounds, even the bread on the table was insane.. kind of a croissant meets cheese danish mixture... . . I went ahead and ordered, what turned out to be, the largest Australian Lobster Tail I have Ever Seen.. EASILY 3 lbs... they cooked it in butter and garlic sauce.. I have been eating australian lobster tail since the age of 8 and this is the BEST I have ever eaten.. bar none.. . . Would I go back?... well first, I'm going to sleep off the food coma and spend about 3 hours in the gym tomorrow morning, but after that.. I'm heading back there tomorrow.. for lunch!
