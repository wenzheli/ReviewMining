Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
The Pasta Bowl was some of the best cheap Italian food I have ever had.  For two people (without drinks) our meal was under 20 dollars before tip and tax.  I felt that the food quality was way above that.  I found the pasta to be cooked properly and the sauce was well spiced but not overly salty or garlicky (like many cheap Italian places, I have found.)  My friend had one of the subs and was not quite as satisfied as I was...so maybe I would recommend sticking to the namesake of the place...pasta.  Great place for a quick informal dinner!
