I'm really suprised by the great reviews for this place. My experience was awful. . . My husband and I have a running joke - after trying "someplace new" one night and being really dissapointed we started reminding each other "when we want to try someplace new, we should try someplace old". I finally figured out that for us, it really does apply to sushi in Chicago. We adore Toro - yeah the wait can be long but we have never spent more that $40 for a ton of food and it is always amazing. We should have just gone back there instead of trying Wakamono. . . We were seated immediately for an early weekend dinner. Our waitress gave us plastic cups for our wine - classssy! - and brought us some tasty nibbles. Sadly, these were the BEST part of the meal. . . The jalepeno miso was nothing special and it only had two small pieces of tofu, which is my favorite part. Our rolls were awful - the salmon roll was falling apart when it reached the table and the pieces of fish it in were disgustingly huge. Okay, I like raw fish, but I don't want a 3 ounce piece of it in my mouth with no rice. I shouldn't have to unhinged my jaw to get a giant piece of sushi roll into my mouth, only to find out I am now left with a huge gob of raw fish in it. Like I said, I eat sushi (both rolls and nigiri) so it's not like I don't like the taste of raw fish, but I actually gagged three times before I managed to swallow that beast. . . For the quality of the sushi (horrible) this place is way overpriced. But then again, I wouldn't come back if you paid me.
