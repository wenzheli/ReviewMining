Restaurant: Sapori Trattoria
Category: Italian
Sapori is dead center between where I live and my friend lives so we decided to give it a shot.. . The caprese was good, though tomatoes still out of season.  I had the special rigatoni which was a very large portion and my friend had chicken with mushroom sauce that he thought was good.. . This restaurant is shy of greatness but the good food and quaint atmosphere with exposed brick and warm lighting would lure me back.
