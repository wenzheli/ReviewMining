Restaurant: Milk &amp; Honey Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Pros:. Affordable and plenty of food.. Not too many options on the menu, so not overwhelming.. Easy to find street parking. Orange Brioche French Toast + Huevos Rancheros---I Die.. Don't have to wait for more than 30 mins for a table on the weekends.... . Cons:. Line of people waiting makes everyone very aware that this is not the place to stew over your breakfast.. Not good for groups.
