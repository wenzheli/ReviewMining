Brunch here is alright. They have an extensive menu, which can be overwhelming -and some of their "out there" ideas are exactly that - way out there.. . Once I conned myself into thinking I wanted a sweet/savory breakfast so I got some "California"-ish crepe with avocado and eggs and other things...it tasted as weird as it sounds.. . Boyfriend, who loves sweet things, said the Cinnamon Roll French Toast was good, but almost too sweet for him (never would I have imagined that possible).. . Their skillets are decent, their eggs benedict IS good (but I don't know if i'd hail it as the best in the city like they do...), overall it's just your average brunch place on Michigan. I'd never wait more than a half hour for brunch here though, and I've seen people do that a lot.
