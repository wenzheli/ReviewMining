Restaurant: Milk &amp; Honey Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
i really like milk and honey.  Their food is wholesome and good.  If it wasn't so busy I would go much more often.  . . I'm surprised to hear about people getting bad service.  I think that a lot of people walk in with "restaurant service" on the brain.  But Milk and Honey is a counter service establishment so I do not expect a bunch of people fawning all over me and kissing my ass (i mean...it would be a nice touch...but that's a whole other subject). . its a dog friendly place and they always have lots and lots of umbrellas.  I've never waited more than 15 min for an outside table so I'm pretty happy with that.  Although I like to go when it isn't as busy. . . granola, huevos rancheros, and the iced tea or coffee are must haves!
