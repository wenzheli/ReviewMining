Restaurant: Mayan Palace Mexican Cuisine
Category: Mexican
The thing that really struck me about Mayan Palace was how friendly the staff was.  They were awesome!  Now for the other details worthy of a five-star review.. . Ambiance: warm and cozy.. . Margaritas: I love self-proclaimed superiority.  World's Greatest Margaritas, you say?  You go, Mayan Palace.  Confidence is sexy . . . even in a margarita.. . Salsa: Yum.  just the right amount of spice and not too chunky.. . Food:  I judge Mexican restaurants based on one of two dishes: flautas or enchiladas suizas.  I went suizas at Mayan Palace.  The ranchero sauce was a little different than other places.  It was smokier.  But spicy and very tasty.  The chicken was really nice white meat.  The rice and beans were not the best I've ever had, but with outstanding salsa and a pitcher of the world's best margaritas, who cares?  Nobody's perfect.  Except for me.
