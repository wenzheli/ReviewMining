Tru is ballet for food. If you have a chance to dine at Tru, go. At first I felt a little silly -- are they serious about this performance they put on? It's just food. I even laughed once.. . But if you just get into it and accept it for what it is (part food, part performance), you'll have a ball. My only regret is that we didn't spring for the caviar staircase.
