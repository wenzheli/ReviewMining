Restaurant: Zed451
Category: Steakhouses
I went here with my fiance for Valentine's Day dinner.  When you walk in, the restaurant has a nice vibe and beautiful decor.  . . I've been to Texas de Brazil and Fogo de Chao, which Zed451 is somewhat similar since they have the passed meat on skewers, but what is pretty awesome about Zed is that they have seafood as well.  The mahi mahi tempura and crabmeat beignet was very delicious.  The harvest table had a nice variety of veggie selection, cheese, bread, and pasta.  There was also soup and condiments for almost all of the selections.  I love condiments.. . Additionally, our server was super nice and everyone tried to make sure we were getting enough food or getting seconds of entrees we wanted.  I almost forgot to mention that the Baked Alaska dessert was SUPERB.  I usually don't like sweets, but this dessert was phenomenal.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone interested in going out with a date, friends, or family.
