Restaurant: Spacca Napoli
Category: Pizza
The pizza at Spacca Napoli is nothing short of amazing. It is soft and foldable.  The spices, cheese, and sauces are so great I ate it so fast. The pizza is a delicacy rather than a staple. Uneven dough, slightly charred, perfectly cooked with the ingredients spread artistically.  They run a tight, quick kitchen.  I also had a wonderful arugula salad to start and coffee to finish, but I still think about the pizza which was so unique, tender and beautifully good.  It is worth the wait if you have to wait.  Know that their kitchen will close earlier on weeknights. The only qualm about this place is the wait. They might treat you to a tiny slice while you wait or a little rolled treat when you sit, but it doesn't help move things along. I would say order a drink because it will take the edge off while you wait. Perhaps then you won't get impatient looking at an empty table with your name on it or see other people get their food before you although they sat down after you. I say it is worth the wait when they are busy because it is one of the best pizzas I've ever had but it will get you p.o.ed if you are prone to low blood sugar and impatience.
