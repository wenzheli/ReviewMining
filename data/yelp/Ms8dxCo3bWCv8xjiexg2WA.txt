Restaurant: Gino&#39;s East
Category: Pizza
Pizza taste is very subjective.  I get it.  Gino's thin crust spinach pie is my 2nd favorite pizza ever.  Well, maybe 3rd or 4th.  Okay, it goes like this.... . 1.) Anna Maria's-Brooklyn, NY. 2.) Ben's Pizza- NY. 3.) Famous Rays (THE REAL ONE on 6th ave. and 11th st.) NYC. 4.) Gino's East. . My brother got deep dish and he prefers Giordano's.  I found Giordano's to be quite bland.. . Our waitress, Angela was top notch!
