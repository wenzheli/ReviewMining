I'm going to keep this review short, because I don't want to share this place with anyone!  I want it to remain my little secret.  . . Glenn's Diner is AWESOME.  Here's what sealed the deal for me.  I went with a group of 5 girls and we each ordered a different fish dish.  Half way through dinner we each passed our plates to the right, all the way around until everyone had a bite of each dish.  Every single dish was amazing.  We were floored by the high quality and delicious flavor of everyone's order.  . . Nothing further.  Let's keep this place a secret!!
