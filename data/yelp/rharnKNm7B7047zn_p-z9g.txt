Restaurant: The Pasta Bowl
Category: Italian
Two words: Gnocchi Aurora. (as many Yelpers have already claimed). . Seriously, this has to be the best Italian place in the DePaul vicinity. All of the pasta is always fresh, and all of the food is always delicious. I wish they had a lunch special during the weekdays. Regardless, it's definitely all worth it.
