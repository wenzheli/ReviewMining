Finally made my way over to Greektown after 5 years of living in the city. I know, I'm ashamed of myself. But did I pick the right spot to hit or what!. . What I love about the place:. 1. Fried Zucchini. 2. Fried Zucchini. 3. Fried Zucchini. . Would have liked to have some more vegetarian entree options on the menu, but whatever I had was really good. Loved the small spaghetti side. Delicious. Really want to give it 3.5 stars, but what the heck.. . P.S. They have free valet. Don't drive around the block a couple of times and miss the sign like we did!
