I had my birthday party here on a Monday night in July.  It was great!  We worked with Patrick and he let my family and friends in early to decorate and set-up for my arrival.  They had the entire back area saved for us and had great service for food and drinks (and shots) all night long.  Greg Haus was DJing, the service was consistent and fast.  It was one of the best nights ever!. . Its a super cozy restaurant... fireplace, book case, dark red wood, lounging chairs w/ low tables and two bars.  Plenty room to sit and a cute outdoor area.
