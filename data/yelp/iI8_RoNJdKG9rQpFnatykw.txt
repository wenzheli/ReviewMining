Pasadit is the bomb.  Their burritos are a bundle of meaty goodness. I always get the carne asada with onions and cilantro. My only recommendation is that you don't go to the sit down location. For some reason I don't think the food is as good there as the take away/bar spots at the other two.  Maybe I just expected more from the sit down atmosphere, but I now exclusively hit the location on the East side of Ashland.  They people there seem like the burrito experts to me!
