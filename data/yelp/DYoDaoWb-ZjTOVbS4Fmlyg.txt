we did the family style dinner with my bf's family - lots of food and fun!. . we had to wait in the bar for a little while to be seated, but the bartender was quick and attentive, so the wait wasn't terrible.. . after being seated, we poured over the menu before deciding on famly style.  our server helped us select wine and the dinner options.  water refills were LIGHTNING FAST and our server was very attentive as well.. . honestly, i can't remember the names of the food we chose for each course - but everything was tasty from start to finish and portioned very well for 6 people.. . a great place for groups and out of towners --- OPAAA!
