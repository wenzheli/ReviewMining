I come here every time I'm in Chicago and I crave it when I'm away!. I've had several of the crepes and I liked them all. I think the dessert crepes are good, but the savory crepes are really the show stoppers. . Try the marrakech or the iberico crepe and definitely add the merguez (if you eat lamb). Order a turkish coffee with your meal. And enjoy all the extras that make this place great - the cucumber in the water, the delicious sweet potato soup to start your meal, and the yummy hot sauce that is good on everything (except maybe the dessert crepes).
