Restaurant: Glenn&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
this quaint lil' diner on a saturday morning seems like the place to be.  . the outdoor dining and diverse menu attracts many that pass by.  this is how i got sucked in.. .  i ordered the scrambled eggs dish with honey ham.  i like that they put parmesan cheese and green onions in the eggs but they went a little too crazy on the green onions.  the cheesy hash brown patties were really good but i think they burned it a little.  . the eggs benedict here are pretty good but i've had better.  . . on the brighter side, i like how they have cereal on their menu.  you get 2 refills and a little bowl of fresh blueberries with your order of cereal.  that's kinda nice.. . despite my complaints of the breakfast i ordered (i did not order all three dishes for myself), i definitely have to come back to try out their lunch and dinner dishes.  looking at their menu, they have many different seafood entrees that sound yummy.  that's partially why i give it four stars.  the other reason is that i like the service and the fact that there is outdoor dining.  . . aahh...nothing better than enjoying your meal under the sun.
