Restaurant: Milk &amp; Honey Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
it's hard to make a decision at milk+honey...there so many good options between the sandwiches, omelets, scones, muffins.... . cute and tiny, with outdoor seating in the summer. it's a great brunch spot, but you will be eating right next to randos basically, and expect the line to order food to be pretty long.
