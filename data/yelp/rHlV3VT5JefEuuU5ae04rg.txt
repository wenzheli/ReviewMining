Went here for lunch. Only decent. Appetizers were very good - great saganaki and "cold plate sampler" but things kind of went downhill after this. I had the la costa chicken special. 2 pieces of dark meat and 1 piece of white meat. unfortunately the white meat was incredibly dry and everything was soaking in oil - very little flavor otherwise. Dessert was good and we did some shots for lunch which were generously poured. Hey - it's the holidays. :) This seems like a cozy spot at night and I"m sure based on other reviews some of the other dishes are better, but I've definitely enjoyed some of the other Greek places in that 'hood more.
