3.5 stars, but i must admit i'm not a huge meat eater.  if i was, i think it would be 4.. . the salad bar was nice.  asparagus was really fresh.  but who really goes to a brazilian steak house to eat asparagus?. . meats galore!  from tasty filet mignon to super fat juicy shrimp to fall off the bone beef ribs and the sweetest pineapple ever.  all good stuff.. . shared carrot cake and chocolate raspberry cake.  yes, a little gluttonous, but i can't pass up dessert.. . with a 2 for 1 coupon, paid $50 a person (four of us total).  kinda pricey, but if you're a big guy with a big appetite, then definitely worth it.  for a not so big girl who'd rather eat chocolate than a steak, maybe not so much.
