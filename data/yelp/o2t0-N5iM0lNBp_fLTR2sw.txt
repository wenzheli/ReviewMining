Amazing food but overpriced.  They make a good bloody mary, which soothes the pain of the big tab- and the service is good.  This is a good place to go with a big group because the seating is ample and very comfortable.  The menu is very tempting, with a lot of food that sounds like it would be delicious- but really high in calories.  Its basically fancy bar food.  This is the type of place you can't go if you are trying to eat healthy because they serve you a huge pile of food and 1/3 of it is going to be cheese.  Even the salads are bad for you- like Chillies or TGI Fridays or something but with stained glass.  I would say try this place when you want to be gluttonous and don't mind spending money.
