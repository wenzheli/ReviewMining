I've dated girls much like this place and though may have loved them deeply still found myself walking away in search of someone else to fit me better as well as allowing another better suited person to bring smiles and warmth to her.. . Its not bad, but it was not so good for me. . . Its a family place sweet, but little unattended bored kids running back and forth not so sweet.. . Its fairly cute and quiet in the early and later hours, but come prime dinner time 7-9 its an all out gangbang with plates, people and food flying everywhere.. . The staff, yes they smile and are attentive, but yes only human as the tsunami of their evening rush felt close to washing a few of them away.. It was entertaining at the least to see their hardworking bodies fly back and forth with plates both ways, but in the end, their heightened frenzy to please did not help me feel any less frazzled myself.. . Okay now the food....as we did the Monday Familia Style Special...it was priced accordingly. i did waddle out pushing maximum density, but  the food though good, still days later does not water makes my mouth.. . As described in other reviews, there were a few steps lacking in the execution, the love and passion were there, but maybe the corners they cut to put the food out in time were not worth the end result.. . But hey, maybe another will find ST beautiful and give her the love she needs....just not me.
