mmmm it's yummy and so dern purdy. . This place has Thai food and Sushi, too!. It's definitely a nice looking place to have dinner if you're in the mood from some grub of the East. It's very classy, the service is super and the prices are pretty, good, too. I think a noodle dish hovered around $6.50 or $7.00.
