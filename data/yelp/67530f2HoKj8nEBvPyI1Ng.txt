Restaurant: Yolk
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
We ventured over to Yolk after the Shamrock Shuffle this year.  Which means 1) that it was packed, and 2) we weren't opposed to eating enormous meals and pretending that we burned twice as many calories racing than we typically do on daily five mile runs.. . We opted for counter service, which "sped up" our wait to about 30 minutes for two, which still seems ridiculous for a relatively rote breakfast.  Big shocker, with a name like Yolk, but the frittata/omelette/benedict/scramble options and combinations are quite extensive.  And most come with an optional side of pancakes, which is perfect for those of us who are indecisive.  For an additional price, you can (and should) upgrade the pancakes to one of their "fancy" varieties.. . If you can wait for your table at a nearby friend's house or hanging out in the park, I'd say it's worth a try!
