Restaurant: Spacca Napoli
Category: Pizza
I really like Spacca Napoli. It's a short walk from home, the servers are lovely, the food is almost always fresh and delicious (sometimes the pizza is a bit soggy, but, I'll live), and the specials are always exciting. It's not going to blow your mind, it's not perfect, but it's solid. And they finally take reservations, which is just so much easier.. . I've got just one little beef. They don't allow you to bring in your own bottle of wine and open it for a corkage fee. Come on! I had a bottle of wine that I wanted to bring in because it would be fabulous with their prosciutto and arugula pizza, but it's not allowed? Please. Even the fanciest of fancy restaurants "allow" you to bring in a bottle which they open for a sometimes hefty fee (which I totally understand), but it's not about the money, it's about the FOOD and the experience, and a restaurant that prides itself on being so traditionally and hospitably Italian should understand that. If you're going to talk the talk, Spacca Napoli, you should learn to walk the walk.
