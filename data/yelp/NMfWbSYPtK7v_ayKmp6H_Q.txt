Brunch on a Sunday-this is one of the best places to go. I hate mojitos but my boyfriend loves them, as do his friends, and they can't get enough of them. I'm a mimosa girl myself and those are pretty tasty here as well. I have tried the Breakfast Burrito-eggs, potatoes, green peppers, onions, cheese and chorizo if you wish. It's huge and so delicicious-I could still only eat half! I have also tried the Portabella Mushroom Quesadillas from the brunch menu-phenomenal!! You just have to try them. My friends seems to always get the Honey Jalapeno pork chops. I hate pork chops and I hate spicy stuff and these things are soooo good! If you like cuban food and want something a little different for brunch, that will hold a large group of your friends, serve great morning drinks, and has live music then you should go here. It's also great for dinner!
