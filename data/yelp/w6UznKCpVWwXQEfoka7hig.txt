During my last visit to Chicago for an event, my husband and I had to try the deep dish pizza before our departure. As native and curious New Yorkers, we love to try anything that is different from the norm! And this place really hits the spot! For anyone who has never experienced a deep dish pizza, be prepared for a feast! The pie was unbelievably huge, deep-cut slices packed with toppings both in and out! Service was friendly and prompt, we waited about 15 mins for our pie. I could not eat more than two slices, my husband was stuffed after the third slice. We had about five slices remaining. This is a great place to bring family and friends.
