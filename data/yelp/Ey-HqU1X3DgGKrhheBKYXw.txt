On a magical snowy Christmas afternoon, a gaggle of yelp renegades put the kibosh on a traditional Christmas of drunken uncles, grandmas in ugly sweaters, and judgemental moms (I always liked your hair the other way dear) in favor of our own reenactment of that famous scene in "A Christmas Story". . . As we all made our trek from far and wide to Sun Wah, the city was being blanketed in snow. All the more reason for us to pour a taller glass of wine, or open that second beer before we even order. Just as our stomachs were about to be heard over our conversations, the ducks finally arrived. They were a sight to behold. Our server went to town carving him up while we all eyed the plate greedily. Luckily, I was sitting on the end of the table with some figure conscious diners. That meant that I had pretty much all the wonderful, crunchy duck skin my little heart desired. Seriously, when I stuffed my bread with the carrots, daikon, green onion and plum sauce - the meat to skin ration was fifty fifty for sure. Yum! Since we ordered two ducks we tried the duck fried rice and the duck lo mein. Trust me, lo mein is absolutely the way to go. The soup wasn't my favorite - but soup isn't really my thing in the first place. We also did some veggie plates to share. The baby bok choy and the chinese broccoli in garlic sauce were scrumptious as well. . . Now for the bad. The ladies bathroom was pretty icky. There was quite a bit of water coming up from the sewer. Heard it was the same for the men's room. Also, some of the diners with us came across some not so clean utensils. Also pretty icky - but at least it didn't happen to me :p . . I was going to say that I held back on that 5th star because none of the waiters sang "Fa Ra Ra Ra Ra" to us, but since that wouldn't be fair - it'll just be for the lack of complete cleanliness.
