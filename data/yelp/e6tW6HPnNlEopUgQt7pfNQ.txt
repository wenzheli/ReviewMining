Restaurant: Milk &amp; Honey Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I must say, I went in here with a bit of a bad disposition. My outlook was bad right off the bat because I had made assumptions about the place the second that we walked in the door. I guess I'm used to regular Booth type Restaurants, family Restaurants I guess you would call them, so when I go to City type places like this I get a bit Claustrophobic. It was very packed in there and it was a bit hard to get things because you have to grab your own silverware, water, coffee, and napkins. That said, I will say everyone was very polite and they all let me through every time I had to get up from the table to get something. It just was a bit awkward. . When the food came, I changed my entire outlook of the place. It sounded weird on the menu to me, but once it was served and I ate, it was so delicious. I was highly impressed. It's very worth it. I recommend Milk &amp; Honey Cafe to anyone and everyone!. The food is very unique and awesome.. I enjoyed every single last bite.. Not to mention the service was very pleasant to boot.
