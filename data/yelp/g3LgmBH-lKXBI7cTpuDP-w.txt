Went there on a Tuesday night part of a group of 13ppl. . . First time there and I will be sure to return.  I liked the ambiance of the place. The bathroom was downstairs, at first I did not know what to expect, as you open up the door you see a set of stairs and I was like o.k. where am I going. But as you go down, there is a little loungy area with a few chairs and then you find the bathroom which was clean and surprisingly pretty.. . So, we went thru about 5 pitchers of sangria. It was pre-mixed, but still hit the spot. I really enjoyed the empanada's. We got the sampler one where you got a couple of each. . . Another thing I was excited about was that almost everything on the menu is gluten free all except for 4 menu items. WOW...impressive. I no longer eat beef, but our table ordered 6 orders of the skirt steak because it was phenomenal. I ordered the chicken and even that was pretty good. . . Didnt get a chance to order any desert...but I will definitely come back again!. . o yeah, the server even comp'd one of our sangria pitchers....NICE!!!!!
