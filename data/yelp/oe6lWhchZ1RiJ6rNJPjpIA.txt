I like meat. And sangria. I also like them together. . . When you walk into this place, you feel like you've stepped foot in a warm, meat filled cave. Its dark, with dark tables and walls, but not so dark that you cant see what you are eating or who you are stepping over. . . We ordered one appetizer for our table of 3, the Chorizo con Arepa. It wouldnt have been my choice, but it was delish - the pork sausage was amaz-o. It was a small appetizer, but probably just enough because the entrees are huge.. . I had the pork loin (OH. MY. GOD.) and it came with yucca, plantain and potato. My bf's steak was even better. . . Monday is 1/2 price sangria. Yippee for me! . . Today's Groupon is for this place. Go buy a few!
