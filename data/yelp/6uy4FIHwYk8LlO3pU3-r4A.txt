I was visiting Chicago for the New years weekend and was dying to eat Chicago's famous deep dish pizza but was oh! SO disappointed.. Sorry Chi-towners but please tell me this is not Chicago's finest!!. . My Hubby &amp; I ordered the super veggie .. and we were sorely disappointed.  The pizza was sooo bland! I also thought the cheese inside wasn't melted enough.. You know wasn't the gooey cheesy goodness i was expecting... Was more like eating a block of cold cheese stuffed inside a crust.... . We boxed our left-overs and microwaved it the next day and i thought it tasted better if not very good.. maybe because the cheese inside was melted enough.... . Having said all that... i thought the garlic bread was yummy!! (Hence the 2 stars). . I am not giving up on deep dish pizza's!! Will definitely be back in Chicago and the next time Im gonna get me a really good deep dish pizza! :)
