THE BEST FRENCH TOAST EVER!! with the almonds on the side for me -- best bread, it's thick and cooked to perfection -- i am so in love with this place....you order and then sit down, they bring you the food -- it's so cute -- the place is full of local families, kids, babies, friends -- the have fresh pastries, salads etc. They open for breakfast at 7am and stop serving it at 12pm -- my husband had the panini and he enjoyed that. But seriously the french toast is SO GOOD!
