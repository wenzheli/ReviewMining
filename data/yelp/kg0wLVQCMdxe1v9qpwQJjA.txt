I just ate dinner here for the second time last night. I don't have much to say about Spacca that hasn't been said here ad nauseam already, but I'm doing to do it anyways. DEAL WITH IT. . . Basically, what it comes down to is if you like this style of pizza, you will like Spacca. I happen to enjoy it a lot, so I look forward to coming here when I can. I think this place is best in moderation though. Helps to keep it from getting stale.. . A word about the pizzas: there are two groups to choose from--more traditional-style with sauce and more interesting specialty pizzas without sauce. Both times I've been here, I've gotten the saucy pizza and enjoyed them immensely. Most others that I've been here with seem to go with the specialty pizzas (they can't resist the exotic, apparently), and it is hit or miss. Some love it, some aren't so thrilled. I've found that the best way to do it is to get a traditional pizza and trade with friends for a few slices of the exotic. That way you have the delicious familiarity of great sausage or spicy salami, but also get a taste of the exotic... the best of both worlds!. . Oh, and finally, this place is pretty pricey. Really, its biggest fault. If you get a drink, an appetizer and a pizza, be prepared to pay up to $30. Also a great reason to come here in moderation only!
