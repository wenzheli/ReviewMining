Restaurant: Spacca Napoli
Category: Pizza
Quality ingredients prepared in a good oven make for a pretty darned good pizza. I prefer thin crust pizza to the Chicago style and Spacca Napoli, to this point, has been the better pizza I've had so far since I've been in Chicago. Everything on the pizza was fresh and full bodied. The crust was cooked well and not overburdened by the toppings. I definitely plan on going again.
