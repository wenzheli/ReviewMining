Same review as all the other positive ones.  If you're going to drop 6 bills on dinner, this is the place to do it and not regret a single dime (or $200 bottle of wine).  I love that on your way out, they give you coffee cake for the morning after.  I halfway expected our waiter to show up with a cup of coffee at 8 a.m. the next day.. . One thing, though, Chicago men:  this is formal dining.  "Jacket required" generally also means "don't wear a polo shirt under your blue polyester jacket."  Put on a tie, dudes. . . Sheesh.
