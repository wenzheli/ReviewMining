Restaurant: Gino&#39;s East
Category: Pizza
As Portillo's is for the Hot Dog, I would argue that Gino's is the quintessential deep dish pizza experience.. . Sure, it has a lot of competition (Lou Malnati's, Uno's, Giordano's, etc.) and these competitors are almost equally as good and shouldn't be discounted.  You can't go wrong with any of these places.. . But, I'd argue (and call it personal preference) something about the Gino's East experience pushes it over the top.  I think I just like the facets of the Gino's pie slightly better...  from the way the crust is made to the tomatoes on top.  From the writing all over the walls to the quality of the food, Gino's is sure to provide an extremely memorable dining experience.  . . Also, side note:  Make sure to check out all the celebrity autographs by the bathroom.
