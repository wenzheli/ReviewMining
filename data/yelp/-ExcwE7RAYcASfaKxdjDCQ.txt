Restaurant: Calo Ristorante
Category: Pizza
Calo is my favorite restaurant in Andersonville.. . It doesn't matter what you're in the mood for just drinks, appetizers or dinner they have a great menu and everything is delicious.  My favorite thing of all is their thin crust sausage pizza it's ultimately the best pizza in town!  . . My friends and I have been going there for years it's a great place to meet up and hangout on a Friday or Saturday night in the bar and have a cocktail and listen to some live music.  There's never a long wait and the hostesses are always friendly and the service is always pleasant. If you haven't been there yet you must try it you're gonna love it!
