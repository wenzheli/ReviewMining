Restaurant: Brazzaz
Category: Steakhouses
The food is what I would call "good to very good," but it is not the best grill I've eaten. What troubles me greatly is the price. We even used what looked like a generous "$25 gift card." But what that did was it reduced the cost of our entree from an insane $48.50 per person to $36, and this did not include tax, tip, and drinks. I would never pay full price at Brazzaz, because even the discount makes this one of the most expensive restaurants I've ever been to, and the quality, though good, simply does not merit this price. It is a tourist mill, like an adult Rainforest Cafe. Overpriced and overvalued, like Medieval Times, Hard Rock, and other tourist attractions.. . An entree in Chicago's best-beloved restaurants ranges between around $11 and $20. Where does Brazzaz get off charging $48.50?. . My advice: Save your money and grill it yourself. Grilling is so easy that most people own a grill. Brazzaz is the latest hoax to sap you of your domestic power. There is nothing there that you cannot do on your grill, perhaps even better. For the price you will pay for an hour at Brazzaz for its rodizio dinner ($160 to $200 for two), you can buy 20 to 40 pounds of top-grade grilling and roasting meats and enjoy it every day for two months.
