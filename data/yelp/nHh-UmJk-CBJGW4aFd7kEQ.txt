Restaurant: Spacca Napoli
Category: Pizza
I thought this place was pretty good.  Service was okay.. . Spacca uses good fresh ingredients on the pizza, like the basil on the Margarita pizza takes center stage in your mouth in flavor.  But here's why the 3 stars, granted they use fresh ingredients, but those wonderful flavors were overshadowed by the charred and burned taste of the crust, then to justify that with $13-17 price tag, it was insult to injury.  If not for the overwhelming charred taste, the crust is good and chewy (in a good way).. . I heard many good things about this place, I wish I would have experienced the same.
