Restaurant: Yolk
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Stopped in yesterday for a post meeting lunch with colleagues and was surprised at how packed they were.  When I first tried Yolk out a while back (long before I was aware of Yelp), I was concerned their location would be a problem as they seemed to be a little buried and out of sight.  Apparently, I should not have been concerned.. . I'm a sucker for breakfast foods and could eat it all day, everyday, so this place definitely strikes a chord with me.  I did not, however, order a breakfast item and opted instead for the open faced reuben with onion chips; it was the right choice.  The corned beef was perfect (no fat) and the portion size was generous and satisfying.  The onion chips (think of chopped up onion rings) were delicious and the batter was very crispy.  Service was adequate, but nothing spectacular and the noise level (as is the trend these days) was very high.  My colleagues enjoyed their meals as well and we all left happy, waiting for the food coma to set in.  It was a nice way to end the week.
