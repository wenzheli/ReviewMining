Ok, where should I start?  First of all, my boss just took us to this place today for lunch.  She says it's one of her favorite restaurants.  So, I come to Yelp to read reviews and most of them are pretty good...most....here's my take on this place:. . The saganaki or "flaming cheese" was SO SALTY...oh my goodness!  I ate it, because it's CHEESE, but it was so salty...I'd probably never order it again simply because of that.. . I agree with most on here who says the food seems like it was sitting around for a while...I ordered the seafood kabob and the shrimp were hard as rocks...I mean they were TOUGH!  The entire kabob was really bland, so needless to say, I really didn't enjoy eating it.  The salmon was cold and chewy...I KNOW that kabob was sitting out..you could tell by the texture and temperature of the food.  NOT GOOD GUYS.  . . My "baked" veggies that came on the side were actually veggie mush...it looked like stew....they were WAY overcooked.  I just couldn't see what the big deal about this place is.  The staff were OVERLY hydrating us by constantly filling our water glasses after ONE sip.  That is highly annoying.. . Needless to say...don't know about everyone else, but I was not impressed and will not be going back.  I still can't get over that old ass food I was served.
