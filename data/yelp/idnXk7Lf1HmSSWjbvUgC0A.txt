Probably the only churrascaria you need to try downtown.  People claim the service is better at Fogo, but really, you're only there for the food.  The "salad" buffet is better at Brazzaz, and although Texas de Brazil has two soups (while the others don't have any), Brazzaz has this great creamy rice with mushrooms and cheese tortellini that really hit your carbs spot.  In addition, the grilled pineapple takes care of the urge to want to order a dessert; it complements the heavy meats you're eating and is always sweet.  The biggest disappointment, however, are the plantains which are fried instead of caramelized in sugar, which is my absolute favorite side item at the other churrascarias.. . The best thing about Brazzaz is that occasionally there are B1G1 coupons that come in the mail!
