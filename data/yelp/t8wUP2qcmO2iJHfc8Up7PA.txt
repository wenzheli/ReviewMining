I made reservations for 10 people months in advance for a Monday evening business dinner. Our dinner was to take place in late April. Okay, yes, I did request a somewhat private dining area because this was a business dinner. Would I have made that same request if I had known that they were going to stick us out in the "terrace" room where all of the windows were wide open and the fans were on high speed when it was 50 degrees outside? No, probably not. . . We asked for the fans to be turned off or the shades to be pulled down and were told that it was impossible. We asked to speak to the manager and were told that he was in Europe! They finally brought over someone after we started calling around to other restaurants to move our reservation and he offered zero solutions to our problem. He said that "the fans weren't moving very fast and that it really wasn't that cold." . . We finally got up to leave when a table magically opened up inside. We only decided to stay because it was so late at that point. The food was very good and it ended up being a nice dinner but the way they dealt with that situation was absolutely appalling and embarrassing. . . I'll go back there for on my own because I do love the food but it is off my list for client dinner spots.
