Restaurant: Wilde Bar &amp; Restaurant
Category: Pubs
Is that library in the middle of the bar? Is that Oscar Wilde in the library? Nope, it's just some skinny hipster.. .  The place has a pretty cool atmosphere; the library in the middle is a nice touch and would probably be a cozy place in the winter. .  However, the food is pretty average. I went for brunch and ordered some French toast, it was a little over done, but I've had worse.  I also had a bite of their burger which was pretty decent.  Service was average and prices were about what you would expect ($10 range). . .  Overall, if you're in the mood for some standard pub fare, then Wilde's is a decent option.
