Restaurant: Uncommon Ground
Category: American (New)
I saw Rose Polenzani perform at the new Uncommon Ground in Rogerswater (edgepark? but i digress...) tonight.   I looked at the menu online and had braced myself for overly pretentious food in small portions.  Luckily, I was wrong on both counts.  I ordered the chopped salad and a side of sweet potato fries, with coffee.  The salad was huge and everything in it was absolutely delicious--the chicken was juicy and tender, the avocado was perfectly ripe, the bacon was a nice touch.   The amount of dressing was exactly right.  I was so pleased that while it was $9 or so (that's a lot for me, i guess i'm cheap) I could only eat half of it and took home the other half for dinner #2.   The sweet potato fries were divine, though I wish they had a half-portion because there were just too damn many of them.  . The sound was awesome and the setting was intimate yet still spacious enough that you don't have to dine on top of the people you are seated next to.. I will be honest--though it was perfectly lovely, the prices are a bit much for me to be able to visit this place that regularly.  Especially if I want to have a drink with my meal.   But when you think about it, I suppose it's better to get one really good drink for the price of two mediocre ones.. All in all, welcome to the neighborhood Uncommon Ground.  You are a great addition to Devon.
