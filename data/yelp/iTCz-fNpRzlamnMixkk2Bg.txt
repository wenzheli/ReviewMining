Restaurant: Mayan Palace Mexican Cuisine
Category: Mexican
Mayan Palace is a consistently great restaurant.  I've been several times and always had quality Mexican food and delicious margaritas.  The servers go above and beyond to make sure everyone has full chips, margaritas and salsa.  . . I planned a big group dinner for 10 here on a Friday night and was not disappointed in how they handled our group.  We had a good time and everyone left full, tipsy and happy.  . . Oh and you cannot beat 1/2 price margaritas on Tuesday and Thursday!
