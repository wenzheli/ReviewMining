Delicious food.. . Took forever.. . Hard to get water refills. . . Sides came after duck was almost gone.. . Had to share a melon ball sized scoop of sorbet b/w 2 people. No option to order more.. . Great tea.. . Excellent soft shell crab. . . Loud environment.. . Pricier than I was expecting for such a large group. (Due to eyes-bigger-than-stomach syndrome?). . Last but not least: . A homeless looking lady asked the duck-cutter something then walked off with one of the carcasses, much to the surprise of our table and the table next to us. She brought it to her table w/ 2 other just as scruffy looking folk (no offense here, really) and sat down. Several minutes later she graciously returned it. . . You realize they reuse these to make soup, to serve to you later, to...EAT. No dirty dreads in my soup, plz.. . EWWWWWWWW! WTF?!!
