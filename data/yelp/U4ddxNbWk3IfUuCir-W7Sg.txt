5 stars is not enough. . . My husband and I have been going to Alinea every year for the 24-course tour since its opening. Charlie Trotter's, Tru, Arun's. . . all are good but no meals stand out in my mind as much as the ones I have had at Alinea. . . Grant Achatz is a culinary genius who knows how to play with his food. Each dish is not only a piece of art, but also an incredible creation of flavor, texture, and most importantly, imagination. My words cannot describe the amount of thought that apparently goes into each creation. This was so much better than a night at the theater!  We first found Grant during his early days at Trio and followed him like donkeys following a dangling carrot to Alinea.. . Totally, totally, brilliant.
