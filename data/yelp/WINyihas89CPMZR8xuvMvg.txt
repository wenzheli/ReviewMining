I've never had Thai food before - I grew up in a relatively small town, with little access to ethnic food (aside from Mexican and Chinese).  So my co worker suggested we go here for lunch and I was willing and ready.. . I can't remember the specific dish I ordered, but it was great! It was the smaller portion (they apparently have a bigger portion) and I ended up eating maybe a quarter of it, and it was great for leftovers.  The service was quick and nice, very simple.  Their potstickers were fried and made out of a little thicker pastry, but they were good.. . I was impressed - would probably order from here some nights to switch up from ordering chinese.  Would love to go back and try the Pad Thai (I've made it at home a few times, and would love to see how unauthentic my version is! :))
