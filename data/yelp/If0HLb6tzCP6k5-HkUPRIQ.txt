Wonderful owners that care about what they serve and their community surrounding them.. . First rooftop organic garden in the world - producing vegi's for the restaurant.. . One of those places you know what your getting without having to worry about making the right choice - all great and always fresh.. . Music on stage is always guaranteed to please. The X Hothouse booking agent is now here and doing some wonderful things. You have everything under one roof. Plus a great bar with a killer selection of beer plus the other top shelf favs.. . Super warm atmosphere - juts like the original location on Clark.. . Standing ovation here.. . Fridays:. They serve up the GREATEST fish and chips EVER. . Fresh and REAL Halibut  - this is the best one I have ever had as most restaurants would NEVER send the $$$ to put Halibut in their fish and chips  - awesome!!!!  ONLY ON FRIDAYS.
