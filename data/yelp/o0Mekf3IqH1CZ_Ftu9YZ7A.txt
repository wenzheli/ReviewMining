Restaurant: Lou Malnati&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Really nostalgic pizzaria with an authentic Chicagoean allure... And AWESOME deep dish!  I didn't know what quite to expect coming into this local joint, but the rumors, reviews, and legend were all true. I had the house fav, "Lou" and to much fanfare, it did not disappoint. I am no expert on deep dish pizza, but the Lou was probably the best I've ever had. Only complaint I have is the weak beer selection.... But the food and culture more than made up for it's beer-related short-comings.
