Restaurant: Cafe 28
Category: Cuban
I probably will not return there despite my love for Cuban food, namely Ropa Vieja.  There is no parking area and was difficult to find parking on the metered street.  It is right near the EL station, so it is hectic.  We then walk in the front door of Cafe 28 and then hostess looks at us like she doesn't know what we could possible doing there.  She seats us at a nice table and the food arrived very quickly.  Our waitress did not crack one smile the entire time.  The food was very good though.  The menu was sparce.
