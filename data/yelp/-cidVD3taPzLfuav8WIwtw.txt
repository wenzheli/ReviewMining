Great food and atmosphere.  However after booking a table, my guests and I where very annoyed that we had further 30 mins from our booking to get getting our table. . . Luckily I was able to convince my guest not to walk out, otherwise would have not have been able to taste the fab food.. . Slight delays in getting seated would not have been a problem, however the front of house where rude and could not bring themselves to utter the word 'sorry'.. . Would give the food a 5 star, waitress 3 stars but Matradee get no stars. And thus I would not go back a gain.
