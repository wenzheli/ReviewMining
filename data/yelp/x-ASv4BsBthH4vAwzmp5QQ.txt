Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
Loved the deep dish. That crust was so amazing buttery and soft, not crunchy and burnt. I ordered the deep dish with shrimp and anchovies...maybe not the best decision considering how fatty and heavy the shrimp was by itself. But overall an amazing experience. I had the 312 ale i believe which went well with the pizza. . . Overall a great experience and a must for tourists.
