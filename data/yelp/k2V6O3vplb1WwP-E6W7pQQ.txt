We kinda barged in at 930 pm last night and were hesitantly sent to a booth cuz they close at 10pm.  I felt bad, but was too hungry to try to find other food accommodations.  To give myself credit I finished by 955 no joke, scarfed my soup+crepe+apricot iced tea down in 25 minutes.  Well less, cuz it was served up around 945 so 10 minutes really  . the highlights:  . A.)  Tasty crepe ROMA (capers, portebello mushroom, tomatoes, basil and cheesy goodness) served with pineapple slice/watermelon-nice touch. B.)  free soup for the poor!--vegetable puree. C.)  hot sauce. D.)  Very good prices $8.50 a crepe--really reasonable. Highly recommended
