Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
Overall service and food was outstanding. A group of about 15+ of us went to Tank Noodle for dinner so we split several dishes. The lemon-grass chicken over rice was my favorite. The wrap your own appetizers were a bit challenging but very good. Watch out for the hot sauce on the table... it's VERY hot but yummy, if you can handle it.
