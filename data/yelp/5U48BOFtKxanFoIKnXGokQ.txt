Restaurant: Milk &amp; Honey Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
Milk &amp; Honey!!!  This is my favorite posh breakfast spot in Chicago!  The ONLY annoying thing about this place is the ordering process because during the weekends, the line is literally out the door but people don't mind BECAUSE of the food!  Locals know it makes the wait worthwhile!  As you're standing in line, try not to stare at the people already seated and happily eating their food, this might lead to a grumbling tummy!  Everything I've tried here is fabulous.  My favorites include the Smoked Salmon with Toasted Bagel, Tomato, Cucumber, Red Onion, Capers and Herbed Cream Cheese for $6.75, as well as the Buttermilk-Granola Pancakes with the Flavor Du Jour for $6.50.  Their OJ and grapefruit juices are fresh squeezed!  Come here with a friend, bff, or spouse.  The place is a bit small and may be harder to cater towards groups (go to bigger breakfast joints for that). . . I highly recommend this place!!
