Restaurant: Yolk
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
I've been to Yolk twice so far, and really enjoyed myself. Both times were on weekday mornings (once around 9:00, once on a Friday around 10:00), and we were able to get a table immediately. So it's definitely possible to avoid the long lines and wait.. . The first time I went, I was a little overwhelmed by the menu. It's not huge (like the novel that is the Cheesecake Factory menu), but everything sounded great and I'm indecisive. The menu is online, so I had a gameplan by the time I walked through the door the second time to avoid getting yelled at by my friends for taking too long to decide. . . I was impressed with the full-sized sides. One trip I ordered an omelette that included a side of fruit and of pancakes. It was a lot of food, especially for under 10 bucks. Everyone at my table ended up taking at least half of their meal home because we just couldn't eat that much!. . The food was delivered quickly, and the staff was extremely friendly. This is a good place to take out-of-towners when wandering around downtown. There's a lot of great food to choose from, and is trendy looking enough to impress them without spending too much.
