We went to Glenns yesterday for brunch.  I was very busy but the wait was minimal maybe 5 min for a table for 2.  The servers were very efficient getting people in and out but I never felt rushed.. . I had the grilled swordfish which was excellent.  It came with asparagus and a griddle type cake which I did not eat.  My partner had the Canadian Scramble which was Canadian bacon, scrambled eggs with potatoes.  Over the top of it was white sausage gravy.  He said it was good, very filling but the next time would either ask for no gravy or maybe on the side.. . I found the restaurant to be very good and would return.  The one off putting part was they listed a First Catch option from 11-6.  We inquired about that and were told that it was not available on Sundays.  It might be a good thing to note that on the menu/blackboard.  We both had pretty much determined that was what we were going to have but then had to do a quick change.
