We went for my birthday and chose the grand collection. I thought the restaurant atmosphere was very serious and quiet. It almost felt like I was in church, and my every move was being watched by many servers/management/misc people walking around. The restaurant employee to customer ratio was almost 1:1. It was almost uncomfortable to eat while being watched by so many eyes. The service was excellent, the food was excellent (but small), and the dessert was plentiful and good. It is an experience to remember, but I wouldn't go back.
