Restaurant: Le Colonial
Category: Vietnamese
So dinner club came knockin to Le Colonial this week.  The host, a very nice gentleman, escorted us to our table on the first floor.  Looking over the menu, there are a lot of tasty looking items, especially the appetizer section.  And on Wednesdays, there is a 'date night' menu for $20 per person (the caveat here is that both people must order from the pre-fixe menu.)  The date night would be good but alas, I was not on a date (insert sad face.). . Anyhow, I sampled the grilled shrimp appetizer, scallop salad, and filet mignon salad.  Delicious!  The shrimp, a must, were wrapped around sugarcane and served with lettuce, carrot slices, noodles, and dipping sauce.  The scallop salad had a large serving of thin noodles and I really liked the lime dressing.. . Overall, the food reminded me of gourmet thai.  I'm not sure that it's any more delicious than some of my favorite take-out, nonetheless the food tasted great and the overall atmosphere of the place is romantic but lively.  For a weeknight, it was a mix of business groups and people on dates (or dinner club.)  . . The only con is that the tables are really close together.  One of the guys at the table next to me tried to play footsie and was denied.
