great food, great atmosphere, great place. . the look inside.  brown/beige without much clutter and very clean.  full bar in the front by the entrance and a service bar in the back.  lighting is poor but there are candles at every table.   maybe it was the size of the room or the fact that the furniture seems larger than usual, but in both my visits i felt physically small, a first for me.  . . the food.  small menu with lots of overlap between entrees but everything we tried was excellent.  the grilled mariscos combination is 3 shrimp, 2 grilled calamari squid, and 3 baby octopus.  believe the menu when it says its char-grilled so be ready for a heavier flavor.  the calamari was perfectly grilled and very tender (no rubber here). . . the matrimonio entree is definitely a two person meal.  big, grilled chicken breast and a big hunk of entrana beef.  the beef was not chard and very very juicy.  IF YOU DO NOT LIKE YOUR MEAT RARE MAKE SURE YOU ORDER MEDIUM WELL/WELL AND YOU WILL GET MEDIUM -- EVERY OTHER BEEF TEMPERATURE COMES OUT RARE -- THIS HAPPENED TWICE.  the pollo releno was simply outstanding and was our favorite dish.  very large chicken breast (maybe two?) rolled and filled with cheese and spinach and perfectly grilled. very very good.. . the crowd.  lots of families and large groups.  of course due to the location and good value for the price, lots of de paul students in their early 20s.. . overall.  very good south american restaurant in a very good location.. . link to menu. . http://0066843.netsolh....
