A friend of mine had suggested this place on a sunday morning for breakfast.  The food was good, but I would not say it was excellent.  For a vegetarian there are not a whole lot of choices.  I do have to say though the coffee was excellent...I give the coffee 5 stars!  I would love to go back again sometime and try their cocktails and some of their sandwiches that looked very good.
