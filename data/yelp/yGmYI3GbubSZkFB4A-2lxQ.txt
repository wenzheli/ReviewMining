Restaurant: Indie Cafe Thai &amp; Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
This has quickly become one of my top five restaurants of all time. The sushi is soooooooooo good. Bangkok (add cream cheese), volcano rolls (spicy), California (better than your average), dragon rolls, butter ocean, crispy chili heaven is spicy but so good. By the way-the crab rangoon is the best I've EVER had. I've had people come in from out of town who have said the same thing. They seem to only use high quality ingredients and everyone is very friendly. Presentation is also nice.. . Only downfall is delivery can be slow at times, but well worth the wait. Tofu fried rice is very good too.
