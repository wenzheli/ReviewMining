Restaurant: Milk &amp; Honey Cafe
Category: Breakfast & Brunch
sorry haters, but milk and honey wins for offering home made, natural, and locally produced products. I know I can't afford to eat here often, and god knows I'm not patient enough to handle the weekend crowds, but I say that the granola is fantastic and the portobello sammich is the best I've ever had. . . I think my favorite thing about the place is that you pay at the counter before you get the food...take a number and sit until it gets set in front of you....no waiting for the bill, calculating tip, etc...its over when you're done eating. . . And for christs sake, if you hate hipsters and faux hawks, move out of wicker park....certainly don't eat brunch there!. . p.s. take out *is* fast.
