I wound up here on Christmas day for some peking duck.  This place is known for their duck and for good reasons.  They had several ducks hanging inside the restaurant and apparently you can get duck to go.  . . The service was fairly good and the duck was expertly card and one of the better peking ducks I have had.  The girl who carved it for us was friendly and exclaimed she had 1800 ducks under her belt!  The duck came with some Chinese bread, carrots, daikon, and slivered green onions.  I honestly liked the duck better at great beijing because its crispier and has less fat.  However the bread is much better but its best to have 2 orders of it because it took forever to get a 2nd order of the bread.  Apparently you also get duck fried rice and duck broth.   We also ordered a mushroom melody with shrimp which was okay but a little too salty.  All of the food came to about $60.00 with tax and tip.  I would happily go back here and it looks like a good place for a large gathering.
