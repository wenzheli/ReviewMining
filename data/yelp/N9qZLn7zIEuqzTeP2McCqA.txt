Restaurant: Sapori Trattoria
Category: Italian
My dining experience at Sapori was almost entirely unpleasant. While we had a friendly waitress and table outside in the restaurant's lovely outdoor seating area, what really stuck in my mind was total failure of the dish that I ordered, from both a conceptual perspective and an execution perspective.. . I ordered the fresh fish of the day, which was chilean sea bass. The sea bass at Sapori suffered from a lack of seasoning, but more so from a lack of imagination. In order to really make the fish sing, the chef should have added some sort of acid to cut through the richness of the sea bass. The roasted vegetables beneath the fish were another offender. The zucchini was rubbery, and the yellow squash was undercooked. The highlight of the meal was the roasted asparagus - but there were only three spears, and the ends were undercooked to the point of being inedible.. . To make matters worse, I found scales on my fish. That is completely inexcusable and indefensible. I am all for serving fish with the skin on, but please, please, please make sure it is properly cleaned!. . I do not understand how anyone with a halfway decent palate could have looked at or tasted this dish and thought it was worth serving in a restaurant. I will never return.
