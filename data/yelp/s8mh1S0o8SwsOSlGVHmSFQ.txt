Category: American (New)
Alinea is simply...Devine! . . In Oct '08, my girlfriend and I planned a trip to Chicago for a girls only foodie weekend. Alinea was definitely at the top of our list and quite honestly, the main reason for our adventure. For several years, the two of us have been talking about Chef Grant Achatz as if he was the second coming--so I have to admit, I was a little afraid that after all the hoopla we created in our minds, we would be terribly disappointed with the whole experience. Thankfully - this was not the case. . . Our visit to Alinea definitely ended up being a unique dining experience and one that I will share with anyone willing to listen. I would honestly dine here regularly if I lived nearby...monthly perhaps ...and you laugh? I'm dead serious! . . From the moment you enter the door, you are greeted by a narrowing hallway that seems to be a dead-end. For a split second, you stand there wondering where to go next and then a sliding door magically opens up into the restaurant. Sweet...nice touch Chef Achatz!!. . You are immediately whisked away to where you will spend the rest of the evening on the edge of your seat. We unfortunately went with the tasting menu instead of the full but nevertheless, it was again..the best dining experience one could ever have. . . With every single item that came to our table, it continued to take the dinner to a whole new level. Each time, it just blew us away. We were so pleased with everything. I took 40 or so pictures and was bummed to discover that I left my camera in the cab.  boo hooo.... . I vowed to make reservations at the restaurant every single time I'm in Chicago. It's worth the money, worth the time..and perhaps some will agree; Chef Achatz is the second coming after all.
