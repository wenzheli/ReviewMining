The best steak in the city.  Marinated and seasoned grilled or steamed...either way it's awesome and open late.  There are three on this corner but this one seems to be the best AND it's the original.  It's tiny but well worth it.  I usually get the barbacoa but recently had the steak and cheese with cilantro and onions burrito.  Amazing drunk or sober.
