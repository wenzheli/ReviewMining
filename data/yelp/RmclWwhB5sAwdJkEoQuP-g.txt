I've been here for both breakfast and dinner, and both were fantastic with a Cuban flair.  The breakfast burrito is wonderfully flavorful due to the chorizo, and their bloody marys are also fabulous - nice and spicy with fresh vegetable garnishes.  Perfect.  The honey jalapeno pork chops are amazing if you're there for dinner.  I don't order pork chops often because they have a tendency to come out tough, but these were tender and seasoned perfectly.  It is a small cozy atmosphere, but it gets pretty packed so make sure you make a reservation, especially for a Friday or Saturday.
