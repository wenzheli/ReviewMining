nice restaurant good menu, and efficient service. As expected same menu as the NY location. Was here for dinner with someone in town for business for the purposes of an interview. Staff attentive but knew when to stay away. For a monday night it was a good quiet place.  recommend the spring rolls, chicken dish was a bit dry.
