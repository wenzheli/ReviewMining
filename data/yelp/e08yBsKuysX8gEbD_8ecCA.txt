Went here for lunch with a couple people and I was really impressed. They have huge list of appetizers, we ended up ordering three different ones and they were all amazing. You have to give the saganaki a try it worth it for sure, flaming cheese how can it not be good. All three of us got an entree too, but couldn't finish it all, hehe. But what we did eat of it was good, the rest came home n a togo box. If you have some extra time for lunch give it a try or I'm also sure it is great for dinner. I'm going to make sure I head back again sometime.
