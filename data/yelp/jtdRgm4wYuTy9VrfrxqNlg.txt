My favorite restaurant in Lakeview.  Great drinks, amazing food, cozy atmosphere and the friendliest staff.  The blackened shrimp appetizer is amazing - so are the cod brittles.  The bartenders make great drinks - love Lisa and another shorter cute girl. Patrick, Bred, Cristina, Debbie and Spark are my favorites in the restaurant.  They treat you like you like gold - like you are the only patron in the place.  Love this place. Love it!
