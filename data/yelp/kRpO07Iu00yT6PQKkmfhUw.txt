Restaurant: Mayan Palace Mexican Cuisine
Category: Mexican
Mayan Palace is by far my favorite restaurant in the city.. . I grew up on Mexican food in California and I was a little worried about not being able to find a place in Chicago that was as good as the food I'm used to.  When I went into Mayan Palace for the first time, I was a little worried because the place looked a lot fancier than the awesome little places I'm used to.  After one bite, I was so happy I gave this place a chance.. . My boyfriend and I go to Mayan Palace at least twice a month (sometimes up to once a week when the weather is nice!).  The food is amazing.  The chips, salsa, and guacamole are amazing.  The service is awesome.  I can't say anything bad about this place.  I love Mayan Palace.
