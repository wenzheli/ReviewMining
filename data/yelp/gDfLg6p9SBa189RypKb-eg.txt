My 1st experience of authentic deep dish pizza did not disappoint. This might just be the best pizza ever. Sure you have to wait (it takes a while to reach perfection) but it is worth every second. It is so cheesy and delicious. Just typing this makes me want one now. When I leave Chicago I'm sure I will miss this place the most. . . Great service, great prices and most importantly GREAT PIZZA!
