The first thing I need to tell you is I was served perfect poached eggs here - the best I've have since my dear grandmother passed.  They were cooked juuuust right - so you could dip the toast in the yolk, and it wouldn't drip on the way to your mouth.  So that was basically an automatic four stars for them.. . The additional star is for exceptional service, neat ambience, and a great menu.  Since I am a seafood junkie, I showed up for some fish the night after my first breakfast here, and the swordfish did not disappoint.  I also took my mom to brunch here, and she said the Crab Cake Benedict finished a close second to Feast (which if you knew my mom is saying a lot).  I've also had the Crab Cake Benedict and liked it a lot - it's definitely more crab than cake, which is fine with me.. . I'm sure I'll be having many more meals here!
