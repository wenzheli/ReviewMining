Restaurant: Glenn&#39;s Diner
Category: Diners
So, like many people before me, I heard about this place from D.D.D.  However, when an acquaintance of mine (who owns an eatery) told me that this place is spectacular, I had to give it a shot.. . I went here with a dinner group of about 15 friends.  First thing that I noticed when we walked in was how small the dining space is inside.   This is great for an intimate meal, but I was thinking that it was not so good for us.  However, I was quickly proven wrong when the helpful and totally nice wait staff organized a spacious section for us.  Speaking of the staff...they were superb!  They offered to chill our wine and beer right away and had some glasses for us to drink from while we were waiting for our table.  They were knowledgeable about the menu and seemed to sincerely enjoy working at Glenn's Diner.. . As for the food; 3 things: 1) Affordable, 2) Incredible Fresh Fish; 3) Great portion sizes.  A couple of my friends got the endless shrimp, which is a good fit for you bottomless pit eaters out there.  I stuck with a tender swordfish and the girls around me got the Artic Char.  All were amazing.  The one non-seafood lover of us purchased a Cheeseburger, which he said was great as well.. . Bottom Line: This place has great service, high-end restaurant quality fish dishes that average between $20-$25 per plate, and has a comfortable non-pretentious charm.  I'll be back here.  BONUS: It's BYOB!
