Restaurant: Tia Pol
Category: Tapas Bars
I am convinced that Tia Pol is not as good as it used to be or as good as its sister restaurant, Txikito, because the head chef, Alex Raij, now resides at Txikito (and will soon be moving to El Quinto Pino).. . Txikito is absolutely unbelievable. We came to Tia Pol as a back up plan since Txikito is closed on Mondays.  I've been Tia Pol a few years ago and remember it being pretty good, but I got to say, I was a bit disappointed with my meal this time around.. . Started with the salad of fried artichoke hearts and white asparagus with a creamy lemon vinaigrette, which seemed bland to the palette at first, but has a nice mild after taste.  I don't think i saw the white asparagus in there.  We then moved on to the pork loin sandwiches, the tuna cake special, and the veal bone marrow special, which all sound succulent and delicious, but the flavours did not jump out at your like the tapas at Txikito.. . Wait staff was not as friendly or passionate about the cuisine as Txikito.  Our meal felt rushed and the whole experience felt very impersonal.
