Definitely a hidden gem!  Delicious food with fresh ingredients.  We even got free bruschetta, but I'm still not really sure why... . I wish I would have gotten the pumpkin ravioli but it just gives me an excuse to go back!. . I only took off a star because the wait was so long and there bar was too crowded for a drink.
