Restaurant: Indie Cafe Thai &amp; Sushi
Category: Sushi Bars
We ordered Indie Cafe to go, the first night we were in our new place. The crab rangoon was some of the best I've ever had! We'll have to get a double-order next time. My boyfriend, who was having Thai for the first time, had the basil chicken and it was pretty tasty and served with white rice. I always order green curry when getting Thai, and this one was nice. Not the best I've ever had (that one was homemade by a friend) because I feel it could have been spicier. Also, they don't have coconut rice, which is kinda a downer. That said, I would order the curry again, just spicier. The big plus, they deliver to us.
