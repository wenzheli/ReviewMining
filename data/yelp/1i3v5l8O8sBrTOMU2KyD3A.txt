Restaurant: Icosium Kafé
Category: Creperies
One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  . . I love all the options of toppings so that you can create your own savory crepe with endless combinations of nuts, veggies, herbs and cheese.  The crepes are light and fresh and never heavy.  . . I also like that they have several suggested savory crepes on the menu...  my favorites are the ikosium, chicago and carthage.  The soup they bring with every crepe is always good.. . The turkish coffee is AMAZING.  I also love their mint tea and the nice way they serve it with a little pot and cup. . . The decor and music transport the food enthusiast to exotic North Africa.  The waitstaff is polite and responsive.  It's nice to savor your meal and watch the happenings outside on Clark Street and it's a warm haven from the cold winters here.. . I have yet to try any of the sweet crepes but I will no doubt be back.  There are as many combinations as with the savory ones...
