Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
I think this place is OverRated.  But, of course I'm a bit biased because I always get home-cooked pho that is not packed w/ msg. I have peace of mind that I'm not eating someone else's recycled bean sprouts. And I  have the comfort of not having to wipe down my plastic chopsticks and utensils.  Does anyone else wipe down their chopsticks and plastic spoon at a pho joint???  Or is it just me that picked up this weird habit because of my family?  It's funny cuz the pho joint is the only place my aunts and uncles exhibit this behavior.  .      I just thought the broth was a bit watered down and bit pricier than other restaurants.  As for service, it's a toss up between snail service or blind monkey.  I hope this is not the best pho I can get in the city!
