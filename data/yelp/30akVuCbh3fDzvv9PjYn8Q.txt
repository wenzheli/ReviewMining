I do not know why I haven't written a review for Wakamono before. This is my go to sushi joint in my area. I always have friendly service, pretty short wait, and delish rolls. They have specials daily and their jalapeno miso soup is delish. I have tried most rolls and I keep going back to the Snow White roll. Super white tuna with slivered almonds....mmmm. My only complaint is that they will not do any substitutions for the chirashi. Oh, and you can either order drinks there or BYOB! Nice to have that option.
