Restaurant: Gino&#39;s East
Category: Pizza
I visited a friend in Chicago last week. When in Chicago, you have to have the deep dish pizza, even though, I'm partial to thin crust. Apparently, Gino's East is one of the places that's always suggested. We went and ordered the 4 cheese pizza. It was soo good! The small was pretty big for a small, so we had leftovers for later on to snack on. I'd definitely recommend this place if you're visiting.
