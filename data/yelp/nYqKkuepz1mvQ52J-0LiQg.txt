The sushi here is excellent and I know sushi!  This is high quality stuff.  Recently, I got the Peter Parker Roll, Oedipus Roll, Godzilla Roll, and Wakamono Roll.  They were all great but I especially loved the first three and would get them again.  I also had the spicy calamari and that was pretty good too.  I've only had carry-ouy so I can't rate the actual dining experience but the dimly lit wooden interior and koy pond is lovely.
