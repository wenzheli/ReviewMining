Dined at Icosium this afternoon with the husband.  I have walked by dozens of times and finally decided to give it a go.  SO glad I did!!. . Kafe Mocha - organic, not too sweet...yum!. . Iberica crepe - sounded interesting, but wasn't sure if it would be delish or strange.  It was definitely delicious!  Savory with a touch of sweet and a hint of spice.  Well done!. . Chicago crepe - good, not amazing.  Lacked the POW of flavor the Iberica had, but still very tasty.. . Both crepes came with soup!  I had veg and hubby had lamb stew.  Both yummy!. . Our server was sweet and the busboys were constantly cleaning up and refilling water.  I had lipstick on my water glass.  I understand these things happen so I won't hold it against them.  They were very apologetic and brought me a new glass right away!. . I can't wait to go back and try some other crepe creations!  I think this would be a great place to bring visitors too!
