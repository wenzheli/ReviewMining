OH MY YUCA!!. ---Wait...Did I just say yuca instead of GOODNESS?!---. Shoot, I still can't seem to get those crispy Frituras de Yuca off my mind!  For the owners, it should be its own starter/appetizer but for the Yelpers, it's not so don't skip out on the side dishes.. . I came here on a third visit and couldn't believe I hadn't already Yelped the heck out of Cafe 28.  Lounge environment, professional service, delectable food dishes and a nice outdoor patio.. . On this visit, it was time for drinks with the coworkers and unfortunately they don't have a Happy Hour here.  But we had an appetite for a few quick bites and Mojitos.  I recommended Cafe 28 because they've always have delicious Mojitos $8 and Mixjitos $9 (or their own take on Mojitos like their Pama Pomegranate Mojito which is similar to a raspberry lemonade according to my taste buds).  This time around, the original Mojitos were a little bland and I had to add my own sugar.. . While sipping away, we tried the Taste of Cuba ($7.25 Empanadas de picadillo, chicken &amp; ham croquetas, and mariquitas served with a saffron sauce.), Platanos Maduros, Papas Rellenas ($7.25 Jalapeño mashed potatoes filled with chicken stuffing and served with saffron cream.) and the Frituras de Yuca as previously mentioned.  All created a Fried Heaven with flavors on full blast.  Cafe 28 is definitely worth checking out if you love Cuban food with a upper-class twist.
