This place is worth the hype.. . I planned a trip to Chicago specifically to go to dinner here. Yes, that sounds crazy, but it was worth it.. . We did the 24 course menu with beverage pairings. Everything was incredible. The service, the food, the wine, the decor, everything!. . I have to say I wasn't full after the 24 courses (and being on a foodie vacation, I had already eaten deep dish and hot dogs at Hot Doug's earlier in the day). If you're going to Alinea, just do the 24. I wouldn't have been satisfied with 12 courses. I didn't travel all this way to be in and out. Just go for it, and you'll be happy. It was about 3.5 hours.. . I can't compare this place to anywhere I've ever been. It's a once in a life time dining experience. If you're a foodie, or want a special occasion place, this is it. I'm honestly having trouble getting excited about going out to eat since eating here 2 weeks ago.  It's just that good.. . PS. Hot potato, cold potato, and truffle explosion are insane!
