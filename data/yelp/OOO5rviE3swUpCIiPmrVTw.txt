Restaurant: Greek Islands Restaurant
Category: Greek
This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I've never really had traditional Greek food before coming here with a Greek friend.  (*Note: I don't think gyros count!) . . Each room has a very distant atmosphere and decor. My friend said each room represented different areas/islands. I've been in the back room and the room in the front right (by the kitchen), and definitely like the back room better. . . I would highly recommend coming here in a group of at least 4 or more. It's no fun with just 2 because you won't be able to order as many dishes and try all the different tasty appetizers and entrees.  So if you come with 4 people, here's the recommendation from my Greek friend on what to order (which we followed all but one) and it was the perfect amount of food with ZERO left-overs:. . Appetizers:. 1. fried zucchini ("tiganita kolokithakia"). 2. grilled octupus ("xtapodi sti skara") -- *We didn't get this one but replaced with another appetizer.. 3. greek traditional salad ("xoriatiki salata"). 4. tzatziki ("the killer"). 5. spinach-pie "spanakopita". . Main Course:. 6. lamb "kokkinisto" - roasted lamb with red tomato sauce (*Note: My absolute favorite!!). 7. lamb "jouvetsi" - roasted lamb with lemony sauce (*Note: Not a huge fan but worth trying once.) . 8. mousaka. 9. pastitchio. . Dessert:. 10. ambrosia. 11. "karidopita". . Wine:. 12. "Agiorgitiko" (Saint George's). . All in all, great atmosphere, delicious food, and friendly Greek service. Take advantage of the free valet too.
