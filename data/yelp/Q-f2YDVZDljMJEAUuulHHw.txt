I made my second trip there today with a fellow Yelper. We met for breakfast and  both had savory crepes. I had the Chicago Crepe with smoked salmon added. This crepe has Munster cheese,avocado,baby spinach, scallions, cilantro,roasted peppers and sun-dried tomatoes. I added smoked salmon. It was delicious. You have the choice of soup or ice cream(at breakfast??) with your crepes. Who am I to argue, I got the vegetable soup. It was a pureed soup, a sweet potato base and served with harissa, a spicy condiment. It was very yummy and a good starter.. My companion had the Greek Crepe-feta(of course),olives, cilantro(odd, but worked)tomatoes and greens with a nice vinaigrette.She chose the soup as well.. The house coffee is like rocket fuel-so strong and flavorful! They bring you cream in a small brass pot-very nice touch!. Service is a a tad slow, but they are very nice, so that is okay. We did need to tell the cashier that we had not been charged for the coffee-we are honest,if nothing else! The server seemed a bit scattered and did mix up our leftovers,not that I minded, my companion's leftovers were fine by me! Not sure how she felt about mine!. I have had both the sweet and savory crepes and enjoyed them both. Last time ,I had the Nutella, strawberry and banana crepes. Felt so decadent eating that for breakfast,like a kid having dessert first! Both were yummy, but the sweet crepe left me in a sugar fog.My fault, I know what too much sugar does to me. . I will go back and try some other crepes or maybe at lunch and make it a salad. Very different and tasty! Authentic?? How would I know?? I won't split hairs over "authentic" food, as long as it is good!
