Restaurant: Mayan Palace Mexican Cuisine
Category: Mexican
the term "kill them with kindness" comes to mind when i think of mayan palace.  at some point during your meal - you will assume that the waitstaff is trying to kill you (or at least frustrate you to the degree that you, yourself want to kill).. . once the you enter the door every employee here will, within the first five minutes, wait on you.   initially this is wonderful.  you feel as though you will be taken care of  during your visit.  after five minutes - you've been asked by ten people if you're okay - and you haven't opened the menu yet.  during the meal, if you don't have a drink in front of you, you will be asked by the entire staff, one by one, if you need another.  you repeatedly have to say "someone's working on it".  it's very hard to have a conversation during your meal as it is constantly being interrupted by the waitstaff.  you will end up speaking more to the staff than your company.  unfortunately, after i leave mayan palace i feel as though i've run a marathon while simultaneously being molested.. . the sad part is that the food is just okay - there are better mexican eatery options in the neighborhood.  i can't recommend anything on the menu that's memorable.  i would suggest trying mayan palace on a night where you have no other options, if you're up for something new or if you don't feel like speaking to the person you're eating with.
