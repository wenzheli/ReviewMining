3 1/2*'s. . I heard that brunch here on weekends can be like a madhouse--yuppie moms with kids in $1000 Italian strollers battling each other for French toast and seats outside. Fortunately, I was here on a laid back Monday. I ordered the egg/bacon panini and a latte...only the latte was memorable.
