Restaurant: Greek Islands Restaurant
Category: Greek
This is the place to experience Greek food in Chicago.  While they do a great deal of tooting their own horn, so to speak, their food stands up to their boasting.. . I wouldn't call this place fancy- more family.  It is busy everyday, but they do a good job getting people seated in a timely manner.  . . Now, please, dont just order the gyros plate or the combo plate.  To truly experience Greek Islands you must try one of their lamb choices (colorado lamb - best in the world!).  The meat is tender and juicy, and if you never liked lamb anywhere else, this stuff will change your mind.. . $18/ bottle of ice- cold roditis (greek rose wine). . Service is hit and miss.  I've had god service, and I've had horrible service.  This place is super busy, so I can understand the inconsistent service.  Oh well.. . Free valet.
