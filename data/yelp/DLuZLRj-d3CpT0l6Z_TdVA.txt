Restaurant: Buttermilk Channel
Category: American (New)
A couple weeks ago I was in Brooklyn visiting my brother.  On my first day of arrival, a Saturday, my bro suggested we try the Buttermilk Channel for an early dinner as I was very hungry after the flight. It turned out to be one of the best restaurants I've dinned at in a while.  And definitely surpassed all other restaurant experiences I had while visiting New York. . It was busy, but since it was still early we were promptly seated and greated by a very warm atmosphere and wait staff.  I found that they had quite a wonderful menu with reasonably priced appetizers and main courses. . For appetizers we tried the homemade pickles which were very crisp and delicious as well as the bacon almonds which were coated with sweet and savory heaven.. We had the ribs and bacon wrapped trout with johnnycakes and greens, both of which were perfect!  The beers selection was decent as well.. The pecan desert was soo fantastic as it was made from real pieces of pecan pie chunks.  . I'll surely be going back the next time I'm in the area.
