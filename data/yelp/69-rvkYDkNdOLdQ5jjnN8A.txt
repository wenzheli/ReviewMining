Driven by this place several times. Finally went in last night. Of course the day after the Superbowl this place was EMPTY. Me and my two friends, two girls and one guy hovering over the servers. I'm actually glad it wasn't crowded. Because I was thinking the tables were sort of close together. I could see it getting tight in there. (Note to self: Don't come here on the weekends for fear of suffocation) . . The food took an abnormally long time to come out but when it did boy oh boy I thought my eyes were going to pop out of my head. Huge sandwiches with melted cheese oozing all over the place. Of course I order the very mediocre fish and chips (a mistake I'll never make again). My sweet potato fries were great and the hickory sweet sauce that comes with them is to die for! Service was decent. The manager came over to ask how we were doing. I thought that was a nice touch but then again what else was he going to do with only 5 patrons in the bar? . . Oh and... . Unfortunately I didn't get to experience the after dinner hot towel...maybe the owner saw you guys making fun of it - Damn you yelpers!!
