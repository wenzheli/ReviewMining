We've been wanting to try this place for quite a long time. Today we hopped in for breakfast. What a treat! We ordered the bananas foster pancakes for an appetizer, delicious. I had the crab cake eggs benedict. Great flavor and not too heavy. Coffee was good. Server was excellent. Nice folks everywhere. My only complaint was that the folks trying to clear the tables hover quite a bit. It's understandable as this place is busy so turning tables is key, but if you want to linger at this savory dish, I'd go during the week.
