Restaurant: 90 Miles Cuban Café
Category: Cuban
90 Miles Cuban Cafe - a little slice of food heaven in Roscoe Village. My good friend and I had a hankering for Cuban food, and we were told the best of the best was this little gem on Clybourn. We got there a bit after noon on a Saturday, and the place was filled (which doesn't take much, considering there is space for about 15 people to sit, and about 5 more to stand). . . I ended up ordering the pollo sandwich with a side of black beans. After the first bite, I was in love. The chicken was succulent, the bread an amazing toasty goodness, and the grilled onions were a perfect topping. . . We also had a few plaintain chips with our meal. Two words - holy amazing. . . Awesome food, fast service, and very reasonable prices - it's a MUST go, and a MUST go back (again, and again).
