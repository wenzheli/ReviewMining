This place rocks! Great Food, Great Service. I ate here last week twice. I was in on business and saw the Guy from triple D recommend this joint. Went on a Wednesday night around 8pm, had reservations and was seated promtly! Only about 20 or so tables here with 6 spots at the bar as well. This place serves Fresh fish, and I mean fresh. They also offer a main menu with diner fare as well. Our waitress was promt and very helpful as well. Went with a family member on a restricted diet and this place went above and beyond to make sure that they got what they wanted
