recently just move to chicago since last year.... finally found a really good chicago style pizza place that's not the typical.  this place have the mom and pop feeling.  we ordered the calamari, salad, soup... clam chowder... and ive never tasted clam chowder before where there's actually more clams than potatoes... and medium size pizza.  got there right before it got busy... we got seated right away... but boy when we left.. the line was out the door!!!!
