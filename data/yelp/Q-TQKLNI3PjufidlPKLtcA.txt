I went there during Restaurant week, and I must say that the Restaurant didn't met my expectations, which doesn't mean that is bad, but I'm simply not a fan. The  ginger marinated duck was good, and so were the shrimp rolls. I just felt, it wasn't any better than my local Vietnamese Restaurant, which is probably half price compare to Le Colonial. Of course, the ambiance and decor is great, I guess thats the value added you pay for...
