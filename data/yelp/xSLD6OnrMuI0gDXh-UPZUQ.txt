omg this place is so cheap! the rice dishes were good, but i wouldn't suggest getting the bbq plates by itself because they were really small (as opposed to getting a combo for about the same price maybe?). the hong kong style pork (not to be confused with the bbq pork/char siu) wasn't that good. i've definitely found better even at my local supermarket. the beef stew wonton noodle was tasty and had lots of broccoli (anyone who eats this alot knows it usually comes with ONE broccoli hahah). if you're low on funds and hungry for chinese, come here
