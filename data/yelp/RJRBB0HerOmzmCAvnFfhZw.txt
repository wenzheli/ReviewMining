Apparently Chicago now has a Brazillian steak house district, as this place is a short walk from Fogo.  However, I think this place is better.  I went here for a buy one dinner get the next half off and we had a great time.  I ate 2 of every animal that night.  I give this place the edge over Fogo on meats and the salad bar also looked better.  Didn't try it at either place--because that's how they get you!  But if you're into that sort of thing, this place is better.
