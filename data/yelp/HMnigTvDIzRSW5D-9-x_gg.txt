I would give it a 3.5, to be honest.  The place is really nice and feels cozy.  As a starter, we shared the asparagus salad which was pretty good.  For entrees, I had the meat lasagna.  Overall, I thought the pasta and the sauces were typical mass produced stuff.  Huge portions seem to be their saving grace.  For middle america, probably a good italian place.  In NYC, it wouldnt survive very long - even in the tourist scam area known as Little Italy.  If you are looking for american-italian, by all means, this is the place.  If you are looking for more traditional italian, maybe not the best idea.
