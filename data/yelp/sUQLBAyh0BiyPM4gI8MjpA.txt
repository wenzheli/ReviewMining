Yet another place seen on TV.  After making the trip up to Chicago, started feeling the need to feed.  Jumped on the Brown line and that's the first plus about the place it is literally right next to the "L" stop.. . I really liked the atmosphere of the place, it appears to have a great local crowd. The servers where more than helpful in reviewing the menu with us.. . I got the Halibut w/ Roasted Red Potatoes. The Halibut definitely tasted fresh and was cooked nearly perfect.  The other dishes at the table included Sea Bass and Snapper.  All got good reviews for the freshness and flavors.. . I will be stopping here again.
