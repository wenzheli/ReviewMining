Restaurant: Las Tablas Colombian Steakhouse

Hmm.. I have mixed opinions on this restaurant. Their empanadas are great.-the pastry part is corn-based not flour-based. Having yams and plantains with your meat is great. BYOB is also great. But this restaurant is way too hectic, and the service is rather poor on weekends. I didn't personally care for their ox-tail soup although I am a huge fan of soups.  Their food is good, but I prefer Tango Sur to Las Tablas for when it comes to the taste of meat. You can definitely share their  "plate for two" among three people. It comes with fried yam/ plantain, corn pancake, beef, sausages, and chicken.. . Fortunately we didn't wait for too long although we went there around 6 45 on a Friday night (we were really worried that we would have to wait forever). The restaurant was surprisingly empty, but 30 mins later people were waiting in line. So if you go there on weekends, go there before 7pm (6:30 to be safe) as they don't take reservations on weekends.
