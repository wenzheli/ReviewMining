Columbia students tend to meet and eat here all the time, so my review may be a little unfair, so I will go by my latest dish. . I stopped in on Friday with some friends and we ordered sandwiches. I had their version of the "Monte Cristo", my friend had the Avalon Sunrise thing, and my other friend the Buffalo Chicken wrap. My sandwich was good - a little on the soggy side - but overall a tasty version of the Cristo. . Fries were good - the only issue, my friend mentioned, was that the toasted bread they use on many of the sandwiches rips your mouth up - think Cap'n Crunch. . Overall, I'd say the portions are too huge - I ate that "Monte Cristo" in two sittings. Our waiter was a little overexcited and flighty, but I'm sure he was a nice guy.
