Restaurant: La Pasadita
Category: Mexican
La Pasadita brings the folks from near and far to delight in their food.  It's so refreshing (pun intended) to have such fresh food....pico de gallo to die for, made every day on site.  I had the Super Quesadilla (the "super" comes in because the thing is freaking huge) and can I just say how awesome it tasted....mainly because all the ingredients were extremely fresh?. . This meal was so  cheap...I almost felt bad for only paying $13 for lunch for two.  Didn't know that was legal in Chicago.  I'll be returning to La Pasadita soon!
