The bar for brunch in Chicago has been raised another notch thanks to Zed451!!!!. . Came over for the second time this past Sunday and enjoyed every bit of it. First of all, the ambience here is nothing short of spectacular! The main dining room has lots of space and just the right amount of lighting to set the mood...not to mention the light that comes from outside. Walked in with my peeps @ 11:30AM and the doorman happily opened the door for me and my entourage. Spoke to the host and requested to be seated in the mid area where there are four wings of seating with a fire burning in the middle.. . They have $24 Sunday brunch, not including drinks. Brunch includes a buffet which features fruits &amp; vegetables, french toast with fresh berries, red velvet cupcakes, mushrooms, oatmeal and other goodies. . . There is a main course that comes with a set of rules. You are given a rock and if you set the rock next to your plate they bring you non stop food. The main course includes Cinnamon Rolls, Crab cake benedict, juicy slices of sirloin, frittatas, corned beef hash, bourbon glazed ham, rump roast, hash browns, maple cajun bacon (some of the best bacon ever), buffalo chicken &amp; waffles (damn good). For dessert make sure you try the bread pudding...some of the best ever!. . For drinks I went with the mimosas which were really good. I also got the Clementini which was something else...very good stuff! The Cranberry Spiced Old Fashioned was very good as well! Lots of people are pretty much sleeping on brunch here, but I am sure this placed will be packed on Sunday mornings/afternoons real soon. If you're gonna come for brunch, bring your appetite because there will be plenty to eat
