I'm a big fan of this restaurant! They always have great service and the menu has such a great range of foods. . . Their chef always seems to come up with a special seafood dish I can't pass up so it's been a while since I've eaten anything except an appetizer off the menu. . . Also, they don't judge me when I bring in those neighborhood coupons they send out. Great for a date night out or to bring someone from out of town.
