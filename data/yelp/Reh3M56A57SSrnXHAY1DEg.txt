Restaurant: Icosium Kafé
Category: Creperies
An ice cold, snowy Chicago pre-twilight afternoon. My brain, body, and soul in need of a cozy, warm place to sit, relax, and even my keel. The lady and I stepped into a simple looking cafe.... . We walked into Icosium Kafe for the first time and began to melt - this feeling grew as time passed. I unbundled myself and sidled into a booth. The decor is Algerian, as are the coffee pots, creamers, and a lot of other touches here and there.. . The service was friendly and kind. Is that cucumber in my water? Nice, simple touch. We ordered coffee and a Nutella crepe to help chase the cold and drear away, and it worked - it was Nutella, after all. The crepe was wonderful, light, slightly crispy on the edges, and warm, with chocolatey, hazlenutty goodness soaking into every pore.. . We sat, healed ourselves, and watched the snow fall over cup after cup of hot coffee as the afternoon passed. This is what I needed, and this is exactly where I needed it.
