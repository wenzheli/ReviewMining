Restaurant: Sapori Trattoria
Category: Italian
Sapori ...a delightful Italian restaurant.. . The food is very good; I tried their fish and my wife usually gets pasta, both of them were a symphony to our palate . Please do not go for the steak, it's just average. I like that this place is kinda quiet... if you are thinking about a romantic night. By the way, they do have a good selection of wines.. . I would suggest to call them for reservations on weekends and Friday nights, otherwise you'll end up waiting for a while and unfortunately there is almost no place to wait. Parking is not too hard to find.
