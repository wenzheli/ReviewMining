Restaurant: Giordano&#39;s Pizzeria
Category: Pizza
This was my very first trip out to Chicago and my very first meal in the city....OMG!...the pizza here is amazing, coming from Orange County, I'm not used to all the taxi rides and bustle of the city, so whenever we went anywhere, we asked our driver where we can get the best Chicago style pizza...high five to our cab drivers who pointed me in this direction.  The pizza here, although deep is actually every light.  It's not super greasy or heavy.  The pizza highlights the ingredients without overdoing the sauce or cheese.  I just wish they had a Giordano's our here in Orange County.  ;)
