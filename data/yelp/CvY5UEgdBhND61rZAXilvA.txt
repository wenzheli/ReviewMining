this is the best place for lunch in andersonville.  i have only had dinner here once or twice, and i really enjoyed it.  my friend, who lives in andersonville, and i usually choose calo's for lunch whenever we get together.  their lunch specials are usually never disapointing.  prices usually range $8-12 for the lunch special and it comes with a good serving of soup or salad as well as a nice-sized pasta side.  i always wind up taking half my lunch home, which means 2 days worth of lunch for these prices!  we always get great service and there's even free parking across the street for their customers.
