Restaurant: La Pasadita
Category: Mexican
When you come here, expect to find parking at a meter fairly easily, and be greeted by the delicious smell of grilling beef or carne asada before you even enter the restaurant.  Also, be careful not to go into the other "La Pasadita" restaurant (you heard me right--there are two restaurants with the same name right next to each other).  You can tell between the two as there is a front greenhouse-like dining room on the front side of the correct La Pasadita.. . I go here for the tasty food, not so much the ambience, service or music (unless you like musica banda which is kinda like Mexican folk/polka music).  One time we went there, they were filming some show in the front dining room...perhaps for "Check Please!" or "190 North"?   La Pasadita is a famous neighborhood restaurant that is always crazy busy, full of diners who have probably been eating here for years and people coming in and out picking up carryout orders.  Food is authentic and good, but not always consistent.  The first time I ordered the beef "stew" dish, I absolutely loved it--the second time, it was a bit mushy and not as flavorful.  Tacos platters are also a good choice as you get Spanish rice and refried beans which I think are made really well although I'm not a beans connoiseur to say the least.  Lastly, some tips: try the horchata or jamaica drink; you might have to whip out your Spanish-speaking skills at some point during the evening; weekend afternoons are hard to get a table, eat a snack first if you are already starving before leaving for the resto.. . In summary, go here for a fast, good, cheap meal with the fam.
