The most helpful thing I can tell you is to skip right to the "build your own" section, let your mind go wild with the possibilities, and THEN check out the suggested combos.  Considering the limited places to get authentic crepes in Chicago - I'd call these top-of-the line.  If you like meat, SERIOUSLY consider the merguez.  That could keep you coming back.. . This is a super BYOB with great people-watching views of Andersonville and a cozy little atmosphere.  The mint tea is classic and the complimentary vegetable soup is to die for.  Add the harissa,  don't be a wimp.  Add it gradually, though.. . The staff is polite, efficient, and asked us just enough times how we were doing, and if we were enjoying the meal.  The chef came out and spoke with us before we left, which was endearing.. . Here's the one little drawback, and I'm going to be blunt.  It's not a place to take a group of hungry men.  Or starving women...unless you're down to eat two.  The portions are reasonable, non-American portions.  Even I have left a leeeetle bit hungry.  . . I like it for a ladies' lunch.  Liquor store conveniently across the street.  No outdoor seating, great location nonetheless.. . Please pardon my sentence fragments.  Some days are like that.
