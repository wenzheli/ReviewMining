Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
I do enjoy this place for a few of reasons.  I like how fast the service is and I like the atmosphere and I think their Pho is slightly above average.  I've been to pho777 and pho888 and a couple of other places but for some reason or another Tank Noodle comes out on top overall.  Their Pho might not be the best but at least they're not disrespectful or have ridiculously poor service.. . They are friendly to people who are new to Vietnamese food.  I like their Bun Cuon Cha Lua and their pho.  I've yet to try other dishes because I get the big bowl of pho and usually that fills me up.  I'm interested in trying their other dishes but I'm afraid my mother has them beat and anything I try at Tank Noodle would be a disappointment.  Yay Mom!
