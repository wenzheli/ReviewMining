I downgraded Naha for the price despite some good to great food.  The food here is consistently great and it is even a bit more pricey but they get a five.. . Did a tasting menu - word of caution it is a LONG meal - but really good.  Forgot to take notes - but from Sturgeon "caviar", to a gnocchi that was as light and delightful as the my favorite one at Naha which is rich and heart.  A beautiful piece of Foie Gras on a meat dish, an amazing celery root soup,  really good bread and incredible desserts by Gale.. . If money not an object - go!  On par with Alinea for taste if not presentation theater, and a bit cheaper.  And while a bit less adventuresome there were no misses.
