Zed 451 is a cool hip looking placed but if you aren't a meat eater than this place is not for you.  I eat meat but I don't know about eating all kinds of random meat in one sitting.  This is definitely for the meat lover.  Our one friend came their specifically to chow down on red meat and nothing else.  The "Harvest Table" or rather fancy buffet table was good, mainly all cold dishes - nice presentation  They do give you a choice if you want only the harvest buffet or both.  I think IF I went back I would only get the Harvet buffet.  The service was great - the meat was coming out frequently but I wish I saw more fish come my way.  Also, most of the meat was very rare, you have to let them know you want more cooked pieces.  . . After dinner you HAVE to go to the roof top bar (if it's summer time of course) because its awesome - so beautiful!  The drinks are pricey, i.e. a glass of the house wine was $15 but its perfect for a special occasion.  I haven't gone back to eat there but I have gone back to the rooftop bar on numerous occasions.  I've heard the wait to get upstairs can be long but if you eat in the restaurant you can go up right away.  Otherwise we have only waited 10-15 minutes, not bad at all.. . I say check it out at least once to see if you like it...
