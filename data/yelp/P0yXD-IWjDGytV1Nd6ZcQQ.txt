This place has such great reviews.  I must've really gotten unlucky when I went.. . I was here for a birthday brunch in a group of ~20.  So maybe they're just not good for groups.  . . Here's what I thought about the food..... I got the crabcake benedict.  The crabcake was good.  The hollondaise sauce was excellent.   The eggs where hard!   Isn't the runny yolk like the best part of the whole benedict experience??  Big huge disappointment!  I also had the strawberry capirinha which was strong and tasty once I was able to mix in the huge pile of sugar that was sitting at the bottom of the glass when I got the drink.. . Now for the service.... Shortly after I got there I ordered a bellini and a bunch of people around me ordered drinks and coffee.  15 minutes later some people got their drinks.  I was told they're out of peach juice, so no bellini for me.  The coffee was forgotten about.  I ordered something else and people reminded the server of the coffee orders.  Another 15-20 min later one out of 3 coffees arrived.  No drink for me.  Another 5-10 mins later we got the other 2 coffees.  Still no drink for me.  At this point I asked if I was ever getting a drink.  It arrived promptly after that.. . I don't think I'll be back.
