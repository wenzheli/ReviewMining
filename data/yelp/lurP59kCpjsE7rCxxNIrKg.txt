We went here last night before the theater and it was fantastic! Not only is it a warm and welcoming place with a very friendly staff, but the food is amazing! My husband and I split the baked macaroni with bacon and carmelized onions, and I had the roasted beet and warm goat cheese salad. It was outstanding. I never knew the place existed, but cannot wait to go back. They have two bars and a bunch of cool seating options, like an intimate sofa seating room with tables, pub tables and large comfy booths that can fit an entire family. The fireplaces and cool decor were a bonus and they had awesome Christmas decorations too! Prices are not cheap, but reasonable, and they had some great looking specials too. Definitely go here.
