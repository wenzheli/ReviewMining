Category: Chinese
The lamb stew served with mushrooms and tofu in some kind brown sauce changed my whole view of Chinese cuisine. It came with a side of fruity fermented soybean paste (topped with cliantro) that was powerfully tangy.. . The BBQ Combination over Rice comprised a panoply of perfectly prepared melty meats. With a side of steamed broccoli, a big plate of Singapore Mai Fun Noodles, a beef brisket noodle soup, four sodas and a Tsing Tao, our tab came to an extraordinarily meager $41 even. Yowza.. . Contrary to others' reports, the dishes came out fast--I mean like within minutes of our ordering. Neighboring tables looked so mouth-watering it's inevitable that I'll return for new flavors.. . The halogen track lighting, exposed brick, and industrial-style row sink gave this otherwise cafeteria-esque dining room some classy touches.. . Four stars fo' sho.
