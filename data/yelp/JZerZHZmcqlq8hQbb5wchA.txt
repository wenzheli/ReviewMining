Restaurant: Wilde Bar &amp; Restaurant
Category: Pubs
Wilde has a comfortable atmosphere, a good selection of beer, and a fine menu.  I've been there only three times, but each time was satisfactory. It's a large place and it definitely accommodates for the popular Lakeview hipster vibe. I enjoy their Dublin Chicken sandwich and my bartenders/waitresses were friendly (but also very busy).. . I wouldn't say it's very unique or innovating, as far as Irish bar/restaurants. Check out the menu, but you might feel like you've been here before, even if you can't put your finger onto why.
