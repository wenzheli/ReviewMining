I've been eating at Greek Islands since my parents brought me here when I was younger. There is almost never a wait- and if you are looking for parking the valet is really inexpensive. (A very rare thing here in the city!) It's alot of fun to go in a big group and dine family style, and order a few bottles of the greek wine! A word of caution to those dining with small children, the only drawback is they really don't have a kids menu, but they are very accomodating and always make my daughter a bowl of plain pasta!
