I love this restaurant! It may not exactly be Vietnamese/French fusion in the traditional sense but regardless of labels the food/experience is phenomenal. The service is always attentive and they are well versed in great recommendations every time! . The Shrimp wrapped around sugar cane is my boyfriends favorite appetizer around and I think I could live off of the bo bia appetizer and be happy for the rest of my life! The entrees are above average in quality for vegetarians but options are limited (as expected I suppose) but they serve an amazing clay pot stew that I highly recommend! The drinks are always top notch and if you have room for dessert, their massive version of a macaroon is not to be missed. Have it with the Vietnamese coffee and it will be even better! I know some people prefer their coffee ready when served, but I like the character they bring when it is served in a minautre brewer, streaming the fresh coffee over the condensed milk. Yummm. . The atmosphere is quite unique to Chicago in my opinion; romantic and chic. Palm trees and over sized plants create some privacy in what can become a very busy restaurant over the weekend. I think the plants even keep the noise level to more of a minimum. Don't miss Le Colonial!!
