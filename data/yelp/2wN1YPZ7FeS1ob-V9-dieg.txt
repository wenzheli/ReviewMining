Restaurant: Pho Xe Tang -- Tank Noodle Restaurant
Category: Vietnamese
This is my go-to Vietnamese restaurant in Chicago when I don't want to go all the way to Chinatown. My parents first brought me here three years ago, and ever since then they've taken me here to eat lunch every time I come home from school. It's not the cheapest Vietnamese food I've ever had, but it's reliably good. The combination pho is my delicious. The broth is tasty and they're always generous with the meat. I usually order the grilled marinated chicken (amazing) and pork egg rolls (always overcooked and overpriced, but worth it for the sauce that comes with it) for myself and let my dad get the pho so I can steal some from him. The restaurant is very no-frills, but the service is always fast even when it's busy. Definitely a good place to come for a quick, filling meal.
