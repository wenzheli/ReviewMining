Great Thai food! This place was recommended to me as the 'best' Thai in the city.  I got takeout and it arrived VERY quickly and VERY hot.  . . The quality of the food was great- super tasty and very unique in flavor.  I will definitely order takeout again.  Though I can't say I am tempted to eat in the restaurant- I've walked by and it seems to lack ambience.
