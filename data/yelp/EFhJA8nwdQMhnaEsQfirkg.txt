Last meal before being executed. Pardon me for invoking that old chestnut of foodtalk, but it is only appropriate when discussing the green curry at Opart. When I order it at the "hot" spiciness level, as is my wont, I never quite know what I'm going to get, and that's part of the fun. Sometimes, it is merely hot enough to make me sweat and tear up; on other occasions, it has caused my vision to go blurry and required me to lie quietly on the couch for several hours afterward. Then there are the elusive episodes when you wake up the next day with only a faint memory of having been taken on a vision quest by your Thai spirit-animal companion (mine is a kitten named Coconut). It is these experiences that keep me coming back to Opart, even though I don't like the new fancy decor and wish they would revert back to the wood-paneled basement rec room vibe of yore.
