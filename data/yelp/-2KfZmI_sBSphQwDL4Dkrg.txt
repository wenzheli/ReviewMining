I went here for dinner the last time I was in Chicago, and it was fantastic. I got there before the rush, so I didnt have to wait, but when I left, it was packed. After 6 or 7 I would make reservations. There is a huge selection of fresh seafood, and it was great. I got sea scallops and striped bass. Both were cooked perfectly and were served with excellent sauces. I think I preferred the scallops because I only rarely have good scallops, but everything was good here. Its too expensive to eat here every day, but Ill go back next time I am in town.
