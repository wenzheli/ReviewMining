Restaurant: Wakamono
Category: Sushi Bars
Wakmono is by far one of my favorite Sushi joints in the city. I have been going to Wakamono since it opened a few years ago and they have been consistently good. Their fish is always very fresh.. this is huge for me. . . The environment is unbeatable. It appears to be very trendy, but at the same time its very comfortable and welcoming. The adjacent lounge that they use as a waiting area/bar is also very well decorated and offers a full bar.. . One thing to note: If you walk in and there is no one waiting, take a glance over to the left into the lounge.. before you get to excited. They queue the majority of their tables in the lounge. I don't mind the small wait.. it's a great time to get a glass of wine and catch up before being seating.
