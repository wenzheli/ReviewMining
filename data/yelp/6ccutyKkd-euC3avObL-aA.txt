This place seems pretty fantastic so far. Ill need to round out the review further after eating there more, but I look forward to doing this. . . I went at 915pm on a Friday night and ordered to-go. Easy parking, easy seating, easy ordering. Im not very familiar with the foods but the staff seems more than happy to explain anything. . . I ordered the Cubano sandwich, and the soup special of the night which was Grouper Soup. Both were great. The soup had a bone or 2 in it but aside from that it was tasty (especially at 2 small-to-medium portions for $5.95). The Cubano was one of the best Cuban sandwiches Ive had in a while, knocking La Guardia (when it was new, not now) out of the #1 spot. Especially at $4.95 (or 5.95?).. . Also to note, the items on the Specials menu sounded awesome. I look forward to getting to know this place.
