SOLID....I went with a group of people the other week without knowing a thing about this place.  Generally, "bar" food isn't my favorite but this is well beyond your traditional bar grub.  From pork chops to crab cakes to their insane Mac-N-Cheese, Wilde delivers.  Very good atmosphere here with friendly staff and a great beer selection, I was really impressed with this place.    . . Its definitely a bit more pricey than your typical bar but, on the other hand, its not a typical bar and their food is on par with some local restaurants/steakhouses.  I highly recommend this place for small groups or to just hang out with a drink and dinner.  Great new addition!
