This is my husbands favorite restaurant in the country. Everytime we're in Chicago, we have to go at least once. They don't have the best of "everything" but they have a lot of the best. Come hungry because the portions are big and reasonable. And what's not to love about the free valet parking! It's awesome. Can't wait to go again.
