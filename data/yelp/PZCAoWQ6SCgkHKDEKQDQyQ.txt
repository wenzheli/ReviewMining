After an early afternoon of pampering, I took my mom here for a Mother's Day brunch. I was expecting a long wait but was pleasantly surprised to have been seated after only ten minutes. The bar area was quite nice though, so a longer wait would have been just fine (well, actually the 'fine' part was one of the live guitar players, DAMN!). Anyways, my mom ordered the stuffed french toast and I had the breakfast burrito. Both dishes were delicious and more than filling. My mom is more of a diner kind of gal, so it means alot that she walked out raving about how good her dish was. Extra points for the tasty bloody marys as well! Would recommend, but I am not sure I would be willing to wait over an hour (unless, of course, I was being personally serenaded by hot guitar player). :)
