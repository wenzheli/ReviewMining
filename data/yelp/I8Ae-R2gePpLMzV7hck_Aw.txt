I left feeling very very whelmed.  I was both full and drunk, but the process that it took for me to get to that point was just not worth repeating.  . . I went with my roommate and boyfriend last weekend and was quite pleased that their kitchen stays open late.  We split the nachos with chorizo, very very good. Then myself and the boyfriend had chicken fajitas.  These were just so so.  They were seasoned in some kind of sauce and I really prefer when it's just grilled, minus one. The veggies were way too wilty and being a texture fiend I need a little crunch in my meal, minus one.  The margaritas were seriously strong and seriously got the job done, plus one.  . . It's a generic tex-mex place with strong (and pricey) margaritas, great service, and so-so food.  I'd go back, but probably not on my own initiative.  Thus, I am still on the quest for yummy comida that Chicago is so well known for.  Any suggestions?  Holl@me!
