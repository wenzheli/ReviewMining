I really don't know why I don't go here more often. Its so damn delicious.  Perhaps because its rather far away?  No more excuses, I need to work this place into my regular dining spot rotation.  Tonight we tried the Vietnamese crepe for an app and it was so so so good!  Crispy crepe made with coconut milk (that you can actually taste) and filled with pork and shrimp with giant lettuce leaves and basil for wrapping. Yum yum yum!!  The pho is still the best in the city, actually the best I've ever had.  The broth, oh the broth!  So flavorful with hints of star anise.  Not too salty but deliciously complex.  Bountiful bunches of mint, basil, jalapeno, and bean sprouts on the side.  I noticed they serve a pho with cow penis...never noticed that before.  Not like I'm interested, just thought I would spread the word in case anyone else is......ugh.....yuck.. . Go fill your belly with crepes and pho!
