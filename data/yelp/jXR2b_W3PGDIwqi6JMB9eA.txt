Alinea is definitely a unique dinning experience, to say the least.  Once you walk through the electric sliding door be prepared to empty out your pockets and loosen up your belt.   Although the portions may be smaller to what Joe Simpleton is accustomed to, their steady accumulation is liable to make your stomach wonder if you are a glutton for punishment, especially if you had a late lunch, so make sure you come hungry!. . My party and I went with the 12 course and wine pairing route, plus a few other bites here and there.  The most memorable dishes for me were the Wagyu Beef with maitake, smoked date and "Blis Elixir", which literally melted in my mouth, and the Short Rib with Guinness, peanut and Fried broccoli, which is a bit like a gourmet version of a Beef and Broccoli dish from your local chinese joint.  . . The two dishes that were the least pleasing to me were the ones that contained chocolate.  The first being the Duck, Chocolate, Blueberry and Thai Pepper and the second being the Chocolate, Blueberry, hazelnut, and Thai Pepper.  Yes you read that correctly, duck and chocolate, but not the chocolate you are thinking of, this is purely unsweetened chocolate, the kind that leaves a really sour taste in your mouth.  This sourness really made it hard to enjoy or even taste the rest of the ingredients in this dish.  For dessert, we were served a variation on the same theme but with hazelnut replacing the duck and chocolate that's sweetened.  Although creative and artsy this dessert really lacked the oomph that makes a meal go out with a bang.. . Overall my experience at Alinea was quite pleasant.  While I may be apprehensive to blow another $400+ there again soon, I would recommend this place to people purely for the dinning experience, somewhere one should at least try once in their life.
