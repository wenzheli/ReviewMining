Alright, so this restaurant may not truly deserve a full 4 stars, but they are quick and they are good!  I had their Pad Thai which was truly one of the best that I've tasted.  The noodles were buttery and they didn't overdo it with the nuts.  It took literally 2 minutes to make...faster than some of the "fast food" joints these days.  I would say my only drawback was their stinginess with their plastic forks and knives!  I jumped on the train and wanted to start eating, but alas..no tools with which to shovel the food into my mouth.  I debated using my hands, but I hadn't reached that point of hunger yet.  Maybe next time!
