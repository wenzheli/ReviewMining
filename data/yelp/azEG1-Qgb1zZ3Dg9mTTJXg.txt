I am thankful today.. . The server didn't hear us order two super burritos and gave us only one. Or, maybe she just thought we were out of our minds to think we could eat two! Good thing someone could think clearly. . . Be careful with the squeeze bottle of cilantro hot sauce... it tends to get clogged and spurt with vengeance! Like, all over the place. But it is SO good and every individual bite of chips and burrito should be supplemented with this stuff.. . $6 burrito + two $2 horchatas = $10 (almost) hangover-free morning after.
