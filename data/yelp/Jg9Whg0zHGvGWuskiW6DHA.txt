The best duck I have ever had! . I hope my mom never reads this. . For some reason this past Friday I had a serious itch to try Sun Wah. I had to seriously convince my girl that the food here would be good.. We walked in and it was a short wait as the place was very busy. As we waited we saw roasted ducks floating around all over the place. My mouth started to instantly water and I could not wait to be seated at that point. . . Once we were seated I noticed a fat asian guy chowing down on duck and rice so I told my waiter I wanted whatever he was having. He told me it was the Roasted Duck on Rice...I ordered a Heineken along with it. My girl chose the Roast Duck &amp; Pork on Rice along with a Heineken. Our food came out maybe a little over 5 minutes after ordering, but our beers took awhile to come out. The duck was immaculate as I savored every bite. Her duck &amp; pork was delicious especially the pork....very tender &amp; juicy!. . We were still hungry so we went with the Combination on Rice which included duck, pork and chicken. We were full halfway through the COR so we had to get a to go box, which was devoured when I got home. (got hungry from lots of drinking @ Fat Cat) Good stuff! Our bill came out to only $26 so the prices are pretty damn good. The only problem I had was with our waiter who did not give us any water and forgot our beer. He also was not the most polite person as he acted like he did not feel like going over the menu with us.. . I see myself coming back for more &amp; more!!!!
