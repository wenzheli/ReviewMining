I threw my going away dinner here because of the aforementioned experience. The duck was just as good as I remembered it, and my friends who got it couldn't believe how awesome it was (and how much food it was). We got two ducks, so two orders of soup and rice instead. Instead of rice, though, we got tasty noodles.. . Ask for noodles as an option as well.. real delicious. Duck is $30 now.
