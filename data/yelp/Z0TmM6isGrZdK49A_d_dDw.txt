Restaurant: Alinea
Category: American (New)
Obviously this is a good restaurant, and it is certainly worth visiting if you can spare $500 dollars. And so since the city only really has 2 of these mad scientists- and in a comparison of Alinea to Moto. I think Moto wins.. Alinea was just a bit too stuffy and stiff for my tastes. The service is awesome, the food is spectacular and restaurant itself is beautiful yet minimal, so how come it was stuffy? The place is quite, you feel like you are in a library, and the servers while very prompt and professional seem very hesitant to chat or even mildly socialize with you, and seem to me like they were being watched by some secret cameras, to be later judge and fed to the lions if they had steered away from their routine.. Our meal was fantastic and there could be nothing else said to be that it is what it is- I just preferred moto's younger spirit.
