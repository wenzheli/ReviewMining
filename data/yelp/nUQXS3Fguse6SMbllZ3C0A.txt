Restaurant: Opart Thai House Restaurant
Category: Thai
Opart Thai is a great place in the Lincoln Square area. They are BYOB (and I cannot remember off the top of my head if there is a cork-fee, so you might check into that) and all the different dishes I've had here have been great. A few other Thai places I've been in Chicago have been either too greasy or too dry (almost feeling like things were microwaved). So far with Opart, I haven't run into that issue and the flavors have been tremendous!. . If you are looking for Thai in Lincoln Square, definitely give Opart a shot.
