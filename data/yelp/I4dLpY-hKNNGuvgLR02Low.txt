If I didn't check out this place on Yelp, I would've thought it was a small bar because it looked so tiny from the outside.  . . I finally got a chance to go there last Thursday.  My mom and I were shocked at how huge it actually was inside.  . . I got their salmon dish (with Spanish rice -- mmm!) and oh man, I need to hunt down a recipe for salmon with salsa topping because I've been craving it lately.  My mom liked her peach salad and chicken quesadilla.  They're supposed to have good mojitos, and I'll be sure to order one during my next visit.. . Our waitress was not exceptional, but she was nice nonetheless.. . I'm so grateful that it's a couple of blocks away from my place because I will definitely take a lot of people there!
