Went here for Sunday brunch and I was quite impressed.. . We had a nice cozy table next to the fireplace, and didn't have to wait for a table (for two).. . Our server was one of the most attentive servers I've had in the city (which says a lot.. because I've had a lot of shitty servers).  . . The coffee was great, and my companion's Winter Scramble looked delicious.  I had the homemade granola, which was a hearty portion with lots of good fruit.  . . We got the food incredibly fast... almost too fast. We were planning for a lazy brunch and we were finished pretty quickly, but the food was great.. . Split the bill and it was less than $30.00, which for the atmosphere and service, it was well worth it.
