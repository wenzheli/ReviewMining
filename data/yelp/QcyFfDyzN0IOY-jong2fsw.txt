Great place! BYOB by the way for those of you who like a glass of wine. When you get off the red line it is conveniently located to you right on the corner. Be forewarned you might have to share a table. But who cares when the food is good it gives you something to talk about. I have now had the seafood salad, chicken soup, the soup with shrimp and mustard greens, and a duck dish. All have been wonderful for the asian taco thingy's they bring you all kind of herbs if you are on a diet this place has a lot of nutritional thins to choose from. Also the menu is absolutely huge I can never remember what I had before. I do have one complaint the next morning I couldn't understand why I could still smell food? The smells from the kitchen will permeate you clothes and hair making you want to go back for more. There fire pot are the best!!!!
