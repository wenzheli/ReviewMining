Vegetarians- go here! Seriously, the best sushi in Chicago. . My favorites include the shrimp tempura maki and sweet potato maki. From the Thai list, I like the cashew chicken. . There are lots of vegetable rolls. They are creative and tasty, not like at other places where your only option is cucumber.. Service is great. Water glass is always full and no one is pretentious. . I love this place.
