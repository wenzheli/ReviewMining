The wait at Yolk. can be rather long due to the mass number of tourists in the area (which I suspect represents their major clientelle). The breakfast food is here is mediocre at best, and definitely NOT WORTH WAITING for, though the service is good. Since I am walking distance, I've given this place 3 tries. *note there is NO parking so be prepared to search out spots on the street and pay for the privilege. Visit #1 I had a steak skillet: soggy potatoes, and way too salty - the American cheese did not compliment the steak at all; very disappointing. Visit #2 I had the stuffed french toast, which lacked flavor and tasted mostly of plain egg, despite the sugary raspberry jam. Yucky! Visit #3 was the multi-grain pancakes, which also lacked flavor and tasted rather blah; even the "fresh fruit" was wilted. My roomate accompanied me on these trips, and had better luck with the salads. Bottom line here is that you can do better by cooking at home. If you visit this restaraunt, I recommend the coffee or a salad. I won't be going back here again. If you want GOOD food and can tolerate the wait, then I'd suggest Sweet Maple Cafe on Taylor st.
