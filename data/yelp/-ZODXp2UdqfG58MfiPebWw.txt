Restaurant: Artopolis Bakery &amp; Cafe
Category: Bakeries
A friend brought me here during one of my late night cravings for sweets. It looked super familiar and it turned out she had brought me here a few years ago and I completely forgot about it.. . I love the feel/decor of Artopolis. It's transitions from restaurant to cafe to bakery to grocery store... it's really cool. And I double love that it's open late.. . I had their apple strussel... or strudel? Well, for all intents and purposes it was a mini apple pie. The waitress brought it out served hot and it was awesome. Especially the crumbly top. Yum.. Also had a mocha, which was decent, and also a cannolli to go. I ate half of it on my drive home, it was perfect. I tried to finish the second half in the morning but by then the shell had become soft. . . My friend had the mango mousse, also delicious. Mmm. . I look forward to eating here again the next time I'm in the area and the late night craving hits.
