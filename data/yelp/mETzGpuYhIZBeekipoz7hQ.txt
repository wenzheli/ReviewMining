In a town that has more than its fair share of good pizza, this place really stands out.  The service is great.  If you're forced to wait for a spell, they might bring out a taste of prosecco.  At our last dinner there, they came around with complimentary cannoli around dessert time.  The Neapolitan pizza is a huge winner.  True to form, with a number of different combos.  I would put it up against any other thin crust pizza I've had in Chicago.  I also like that they don't seriously mark up glasses of wine here.  I had a Nero d'Avola that was only $5.50 a glass.  Some other places would want to charge me $10, I imagine.
