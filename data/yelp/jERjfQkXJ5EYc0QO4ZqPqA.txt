Yum, Yum, YUM! Went on a Saturday around 2pm with three friends. Got seated right away. Fast, friendly service. We all ordered different crepes and shared a bite or two. They were delicious! Each very different. I can't believe it took us so long to check this place out....don't wait any longer fellow yelpers..GO! . . We all had savory for our meals and then split a sweet filled with Belgian chocolate, strawberries and whipped cream. Heavenly. . . Don't order the Turkish coffee unless you know exactly what you're getting. Oops.
