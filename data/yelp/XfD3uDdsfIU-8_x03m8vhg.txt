I eat here weekly.  Usually it's late afternoon lunch, sometimes weekend brunch.  I have not been here for dinner, yet.. . The lunch sandwiches are awesome.  My first time here I was disappointed that they didn't have French Fries, so I 'settled' for the potato pancake.  Wow!  Amazing potato pancake!. . My kids (5 and 7) are welcome there, and treated pretty 'special' by the staff.  It's not 100% a kids place, or family place, but they are so friendly and welcoming that it doesn't make a difference.  They have a huge selection of cereal behind the bar and sometimes the kids will have that for lunch.. . Despite the wonderfully varied menu, I almost always get seafood.  It's always fresh.  If it's not fresh they take it off the menu for the day.  . . I take everybody I know here for lunch.  Vegetarians, bacon-lovers, everybody.  Everybody leaves 100% happy.
