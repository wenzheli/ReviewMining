Went here for the first time today. LOVED it. The decor is fantastic, my kind of stuff. A funky, eclectic sort of arab coffeehouse vibe, tile counters, Syrian furniture and lamps. I want my house to look like this!. . The crepes . . . delicious and giant. Interesting interplay of flavors and spices. I had the Greek Crepe with Algerian lamb sausage. A nice touch was the cucumber slices in the water that made it taste so fresh. The food was delicious - giant crepes that could easily be shared by two people - or one if you're really hungry. . . Very warm and inviting interior, would be great to eat here during a snowstorm. I'll be back to this place. Charming and friendly servers. So glad it's in my 'hood.
