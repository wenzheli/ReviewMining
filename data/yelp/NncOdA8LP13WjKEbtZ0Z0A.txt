Restaurant: Cafe 28
Category: Cuban
Café 28 provided me with a delicious reminder: never estimate the power of a plate of rice and beans! I went to Café 28 for lunch, and it had been quite some time since I had ordered a simple plate of black beans. But, when I saw the $7 plate of goods, I couldn't resist. I licked my plate clean. The flavors were simple and comforting, and the plantains were perfectly cooked. I loved creating bites with a lil' bit of beans, a lil' bit of rice and a sweet bit of the plantain. . . We also had the guacamole and chips, which were fresh and equally tasty. If I hadn't been sharing, I would have licked that bowl clean too!. . The service was friendly and prompt, and our food came out quickly, which is important when you are on a business lunch. They had an outdoor patio, but we sat indoors, which was A-OK with me. . . I am not sure if I really tasted enough to put a 4-stamp approval on it, but if I were in the area, I would definitely want to try more!
