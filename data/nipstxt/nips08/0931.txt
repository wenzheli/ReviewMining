Abstract 
We report here that changes in the normalized electroencephalo- 
graphic (EEG) cross-spectrum can be used in conjunction with 
feedforward neural networks to monitor changes in alertness of op- 
erators continuously and in near-real time. Previously, we have 
shown that EEG spectral amplitudes covary with changes in alert- 
ness as indexed by changes in behavioral error rate on an auditory 
detection task [6, 4]. Here, we report for the first time that increases 
in the frequency of detection errors in this task are also accompa- 
nied by patterns of increased and decreased spectral coherence in 
several frequency bands and EEG channel pairs. Relationships 
between EEG coherence and performance vary between subjects, 
but within subjects, their topographic and spectral profiles appear 
stable from session to session. Changes in alertness also covary 
with changes in correlations among EEG waveforms recorded at 
different scalp sites, and neural networks can also estimate alert- 
ness from correlation changes in spontaneous and unobtrusively- 
recorded EEG signals. 
I Introduction 
When humans become drowsy, EEG scalp recordings of potential oscillations change 
dramatically in frequency, amplitude, and topographic distribution [3]. These 
changes are complex and differ between subjects [10]. Recently, we have shown 
932 S. MAKEIG, T.-P. JUNG, T. J. SEJNOWSKI 
that using principal components analysis in conjunction with feedforward neural 
networks, minute-scale changes in performance on a sustained auditory detection 
task can be estimated in near real-time from changes in the EEG spectrum at one 
or more scalp channels [4, 6]. Here, we report, first, that loss of alertness during 
auditory detection task performance is also accompanied by changes in spectral co- 
herence of EEG signals recorded at different scalp sites. The extent, topography, 
and frequency content of coherence changes linked to changes in alertness differ 
between subjects, but within subjects they appear stable from session to session. 
Second, since most coherence changes linked to alertness are not associated with 
significant phase differences, moving correlation measures applied to wideband or 
bandlimited EEG waveforms also covary with changes in alertness. Incorporat- 
ing coherence and/or correlation information into neural network algorithms for 
estimating alertness from the EEG spectrum should enhance their accuracy and ro- 
bustness and contribute to the design of practical neural human-system interfaces 
performing real-time monitoring of changes in operator alertness. 
2 Methods 
Concurrent EEG and behavioral data were collected for the purpose of developing a 
method of objectively monitoring the alertness of operators of complex systems [6]. 
Ten adult volunteers participated in three or more half-hour sessions during which 
they pushed one button whenever they detected an above-threshold auditory target 
stimulus (a brief increase in the level of the continuously-present background noise). 
To maximize the chance of observing alertness decrements, sessions were conducted 
in a small, warm, and dimly-lit experimental chamber, and subjects were instructed 
to keep their eyes closed. 
Targets were 350 ms increases in the intensity of a 62 dB white noise background, 
6 dB above their threshold of detectability, presented at random time intervals at a 
mean rate of 10/min. Short, and task-irrelevant probe tones of two frequencies (568 
and 1098 Hz) were interspersed between the target noise bursts at 2-4 s intervals. 
EEG was collected from thirteen electrodes located at sites of the Internation 10-20 
System, referred to the right mastoid, at a sampling rate of 312.5 Hz. A bipolar 
diagonal electrooculogram (EOG) channel was also recorded for use in eye movement 
artifact correction and rejection. Two sessions each from three of the subjects were 
chosen for analysis on the basis of their including more than 50 detection lapses. 
A continuous performance measure, local error rate, was computed by convolving 
an irregularly-spaced performance index (hit=0/lapse=l) with a 95 s smoothing 
window advanced through the performance data in 1.64 s steps. Target hits were 
defined as targets responded to within a 100-3000 ms window; other targets were 
called lapses. After eye movement artifacts were removed from the data using a 
selective regression procedure [5], and data containing other large artifacts were 
rejected from analysis, complex EEG spectra were computed by advancing a 512- 
point (1.64 s) data window through the data in 0.41 s steps, multiplying by a 
Hanning window, and converting to frequency domain using an FFT. 
Complex coherence was then computed for each channel pair in 1.64 s spectral 
epochs. In the coherence studies, error rate was smoothed with a bell-shaped Pa- 
poulis window; a 36 s rectangular window was used to smooth the coherence esti- 
mates. Finally, complex coherence was converted to coherence amplitude and phase 
and results were correlated with local error rate. A moving correlation measure be- 
tween (1-20 Hz) bandlimited EEG waveforms was computed for each channel pair 
in a moving 1.64 s smoothing window, and then smoothed using a causal 95-s ex- 
ponential window. The same window was used to smooth the error rate time series 
for the correlation studies.

3.1 Relation of Coherence Changes to Detection Performance. 
During the first 2-3 minutes of the session shown in Fig. la, the subject detected 
all targets presented, and coherence amplitudes remained high (0.9). In minutes 
8-10, however, when the subject failed to make a single detection response(lower 
trace), coherence amplitude fell to as low as 0.6. Overall correlations for this session 
between the coherence and error rate time series in these channel pairs ranged from 
-0.590 to -0.776. 
In the same session, coherence phase at 15 Itz also covaried with performance 
(Fig. lb). During low-error portions of the session, there was no detectable co- 
herence phase lag at 15 Itz within the same nine channel pairs, whereas while the 
subject performed poorly, a 20 degree phase lag appeared during which 15 Itz ac- 
tivity at frontal sites lead activity at frontal sites by 3 ms. Overall correlations for 
this session between coherence phase and error rate for these channel pairs ranged 
from 0.416 to 0.689. Correlations between coherence amplitude and error rate at 
80 EEG frequencies (Fig. 2a, upper traces) included two broad bands of strong neg- 
ative correlations (3-12 Itz and 15-20 Itz), while appreciable correlations between 
coherence phase and performance were confined to much narrower frequency bands 
(lower traces). 
To estimate the significance of these coherence correlations, surrogate moving coher- 
ence records were collected 10 times using randomly-selected, asynchronous blocks 
of contiguous EEG data for each channel. Correlations between the resulting surro- 
gate moving coherence time series and error rate were computed, and the 99.936th 
percentile of the distribution of (absolute) correlations was determined. For the 
subject whose data is shown here, this value was 0.485. Under conservative as- 
sumptions of complete independence of adjacent frequencies, this should give the 
(p=0.05) significance level for the maximum absolute correlation in each 80-bin 
correlation spectrum. (The heuristic estimate of this significance level from the 
surrogate data was 0.435). In the two sessions from this subject, however, more 
than 20% of all the 78 channel-pair coherence correlations were larger in absolute 
value than 0.485, implying that coherence amplitude changes at many scalp sites 
and frequencies are significantly related to changes in alertness in this subject.

coherence correlation spectra from all pairs of 13 scalp channels; superimposed on 
the same means for a second session from the same subject. 
The sign, size, and spectral and topographic structure of correlations between co- 
herence amplitude and error rate at each frequency were stable across two sessions 
for most channel pairs and frequency bands. Fig. 2b shows mean spectral correla- 
tions in both sessions from the same subject for six clusters of similar channel-pair 
correlation spectra identified by cluster analysis on results of the first session. Ex- 
cept near 5 Hz, the size and structure of the correlation spectra for the second 
session replicate results of the first session. The spectral stability of monotonic 
relationships between EEG coherence and auditory detection performance suggests 
that coherence may be used to predict changes in performance level from sponta- 
neous EEG data collected continuously and unobtrusively from two or more scalp 
channels. 
3.3 EEG Waveform Correlations and Performance 
In most cases, coherence phase lags in these data are small, and correlations be- 
tween changes in phase lag and performance were insignificant. We therefore in- 
vestigated whether moving-average correlations between band-limited EEG signals 
in different scalp channels might also be used to predict changes in alertness, pos- 
sibly at a lower computational cost, by studying the relationship between error 
rate and changes in moving-average correlations of time-domain EEG waveforms 
(1-20 Hz bandpass) in the same 6 sessions. Again, we found that the strength 
and topographic structure of significant relationships between moving-correlation 
and performance measures are stable within, and variable between subjects. For 
each subject, we selected 8 EEG channel pairs whose moving-correlation time series 
correlated most highly with error rate, and used these to train a multilinear regres- 
sion network and three feedforward three-layer perceptrons to estimate error rate 
from moving-average correlations. The feedforward neural networks had 3, 4, and 
5 hidden units, respectively. Weights and biases of the network were adjusted using 
the error backpropagation algorithm [9]. Conjugate gradient descent was used to 
minimize the mean-squared error between network output and the actual error rate 
Using Feedforward Neural Networks to Monitor Alertness from EEG 935 
time series. Cross-validation [7] was used to prevent the network from over fitting 
the training data. For each of the 6 training-testing session pairs and each neural 
network architecture, the time course of error rate was estimated five times using 
different random initial weights between -0.3 and 0.3. We tested the generalization 
ability of the models on second sessions from the same subjects. The procedure 
simulated potential real-world alertness monitoring applications in which pilot data 
for each operator would be used to train a network to estimate his or her alertness 
in subsequent sessions from unobtrusively-recorded EEG data. 
Accuracy of error rate estimation in the test sessions was almost identical for neural 
networks with 3, 4, and 5 hidden units. Each was more accurate than multivariate 
linear regression. Figure 3 shows the time courses of actual and estimated error rate 
in one pair of training (top panel) and test sessions. Results for two other subjects 
were equivalent. Table 1 shows the average correlations and root-mean-squared 
estimation error between actual and estimated error rate time series for 6 sessions, 
2 each on 3 subjects using a feedforward neural network with 3 hidden units. Results 
using 4 or 5 hidden units are equivalent. Diagonal cells show results for training 
sessions, off-diagonal cells for test sessions. The nonlinear adaptability of three- 
layer perceptrons give improved estimation performance over multivariate linear 
regression, reducing the RMS estimation error in the test sessions from 0.255 to 
0.225 (F(1, 5)= 1234.29;p < 0.0001), and increasing the mean correlation between 
actual and estimated error rate time series from 0.63 to 0.67 (F(1, 5)= 549.5;p < 
0.0001). 
4 Discussion 
Spectral coherence of EEG waveforms at different scalp sites has been measured 
for nearly 30 years [11]. and is the subject of a steadily increasing number of clin- 
ical, behavioral, and developmental EEG studies. Coherence values are known to 
be higher in sleep than in waking [8], and wake-sleep transitions have been noted 
to be preceded by increased coherence at some frequencies [2]. Our results, from 
data on three subjects performing a sustained auditory detection task under so- 
porific conditions, suggest that during drowsiness, coherence may either increase 
or decrease, depending on the subject, analysis frequency, and electrode sites an- 
alyzed. However, in individual subjects the spectral and topographic structure of 
alertness-related coherence changes appears stable from session to session. 
EEG correlation and coherence are intimately related: changes in moving-average 
correlations of EEG waveforms reflect changes in broad-band, zero-lag coherence 
of activity at the same sites. The possibility of using moving-average correlation 
measures of electrophysiological activity to monitor state changes in animals was 
discussed by Arduini [1], but to our knowledge this approach has not previously 
been applied to human EEG. 
The origin and function of nonstationarity in EEG synchrony are not yet under- 
stood. Decreased EEG coherence during drowsiness might result from inactivation 
of subcortical brain systems coordinating activity in separate cortical EEG gen- 
erators during wakefulness, or from emergence of drowsiness-related EEG activity 
projecting preferentially to one part of the scalp surface. Similarly, increases in 
coherence in drowsiness might either result from increased synchrony between cor- 
tical generators, or from volume conduction of enhanced activity generated at a 
single cortical or subcortical site. Measuring changes in EEG coherence and corre- 
lation during other cognitive tasks give clues to the possible role of variable EEG 
synchrony in brain and cognitive dynamics. 
We are now investigating to what extent moving EEG coherence and/or correlation 
936 S. MAKEIG, T.-P. JUNG, T. J. SEJNOWSKI 
measures, in combination with spectral amplitude measures [4], will allow practi- 
cal, robust, continuous, and near-real time estimation of alertness level in auditory 
detection and other task environments.
