ABSTRACT 
We address the question of when a network can be expected to 
generalize from m random training examples chosen from some ar- 
bitrary probability distribution, assuming that future test examples 
are drawn from the same distribution. Among our results are the 
following bounds on appropriate sample rs. network size. Assume 
0 < e < 1/8. We show that if m > O( w v 
_ _ .7-1og.T) random exam- 
ples can be loaded on a feedforward network of linear threshold 
functions with N nodes and W weights, so that at least a fraction 
1 -  of the examples are correctly classified, then one has confi- 
dence approaching certainty that the network will correctly classify 
a fraction i - e of future test examples drawn from the same dis- 
tribution. Conversely, for fully-connected feedforward nets with 
one hidden layer, any learning algorithm using fewer than f(---) 
random training examples will, for some distributions of examples 
consistent with an appropriate weight choice, fail at least some 
fixed fraction of the time to find a weight choice that will correctly 
classify more than a 1 - e fraction of the future test examples. 
INTRODUCTION 
In the last few years, many diverse real-world problems have been attacked by back 
propagation. For example "expert systems" have been produced for mapping text 
to phoneroes [sr87], for determining the secondary structure of proteins [qs88], and 
for playing backgammon [ts88]. 
In such problems, one starts with a training database, chooses (by making an ed- 
ucated guess) a network, and then uses back propagation to load as many of the 
training examples as possible onto the network. The hope is that the network so de- 
signed will generalize to predict correctly on future examples of the same problem. 
This hope is not always realized.

We address the question of when valid generalization can be expected. Given a 
training database of rn examples, what size net should we attempt to load these 
on? We will assume that the examples are drawn from some fixed but arbitrary 
probability distribution, that the learner is given some accuracy parameter e, and 
that his goal is to produce with high probability a feedforward neural network that 
predicts correctly at least a fraction I - e of future examples drawn from the same 
distribution. These reasonable assumptions are suggested by the protocol proposed 
by Valiant for learning from examples [val84]. However, here we do not assume the 
existence of any "target function"; indeed the underlying process generating the 
examples may classify them in a stochastic manner, as in e.g. [dh73]. 
Our treatment of the problem of valid generalization will be quite general in that 
the results we give will hold for arbitrary learning algorithms and not just for 
backpropagation. The results are based on the notion of capacity introduced by 
Cover [cov65] and developed by Vapnik and Chervonenkis [vc71], [vap82]. Recent 
overviews of this theory are given in [dev88], [behw87b] and [po184], from the various 
perspectives of pattern recognition, Valiant's computational learning theory, and 
pure probability theory, respectively. This theory generalizes the simpler counting 
arguments based on cardinality and entropy used in [behw87a] and [dswshhj87], in 
the latter case specifically to study the question of generalization in feedforward 
nets (see [yap82] or [behw87b]). 
The particular measures of capacity we use here are the maximum number of di- 
chotomies that can be induced on rn inputs, and the Vapnik-Chervonenkis 
Dimension, defined below. We give upper and lower bounds on these measures for 
classes of networks obtained by varying the weights in a fixed feedforward architec- 
ture. These results show that the VC dimension is closely related to the number of 
weights in the architecture, in analogy with the number of coefficients or "degrees 
of freedom" in regression models. One particular result, of some interest indepen- 
dent of its implications for learning, is a construction of a near minimal si.e net 
architecture capable of implementing all dichotomies on a randomly chosen set of 
points on the n-hypercube with high probability. 
Applying these results, we address the question of when a network can be expected 
to generalize from rn random training examples chosen from some arbitrary prob- 
ability distribution, assuming that future test examples are drawn from the same 
distribution. Assume 0 < e _< 1/8. We show that if m > O(-log) random ex- 
amples can be loaded on a feedforward network of linear threshold functions with 
N nodes and W weights, so that at least a fraction 1 -  of the examples are cor- 
rectly classified, then one has confidence approaching certainty that the network 
will correctly classify a fraction 1 - e of future test examples drawn from the same 
distribution. Conversely, for fully-connected feedforward nets with one hidden layer, 
any learning algorithm using fewer than l'(--) random training examples will, for 
some distributions of examples consistent with an appropriate weight choice, fil 
at least some fixed fraction of the time to find a weight choice that will correctly 
classify more than a 1 - e fraction of the future test examples. 
What Size Net Gives Valid Generalization? 83 
Ignoring the constant and logarithmic factors, these results suggest that the appro- 
priate number of training examples is approximately the number of weights times 
the inverse x of the accuracy parameter e. Thus, for example, if we desire an accu- 
racy level of 90%, corresponding to e = 0.1, we might guess that we would need 
about 10 times as many training examples as we have weights in the network. This 
is in fact the rule of thumb suggested by Widrow [wid87], and appears to work firly 
well in practice. At the end of Section 3, we briefly discuss why learning algorithms 
that try to minimize the number of non-zero weights in the network [rum87] [hin87] 
may need fewer training examples. 
DEFINITIONS 
We use In to denote the natural logarithm and log to denote the logarithm base 
2. We define an ezample as a pr (,a),  ",a  (-1,+1). We define a 
random sample as a sequence of examples drawn independently at random from 
some distribution D on ' x {-1, +1}. Let f be a function om " into {-1, 
We define the eor of f, with respect to D,  the probabity a  f(5) for (5, a) 
a random exple. 
Let F be a class of{-1, +1}-valued functions on ' and let S be a set of m points 
in '. A dichotomy of S induced by f 6 F is a partition of S into two disjoint 
subsets S + and S- such that f(5) = +1 for $ 6 S + and f(5) = -1 for $ 6 S-. 
By AF(S) we denote the number of distinct dichotomies of S induced by functions 
f F, and by zXF(n) we denote the maximum of At(S) over all S C ' of 
cardinality m. We say S is shattered by F if At(S) = 21sl, i.e. all dichotomies of 
S can be induced by functions in F. The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of 
F, denoted ¾Cdin(F), is the cardinality of the largest S C ' that is shattered 
by F, i.e. the largest rn such that At(m) = 2 'a. 
A feedforward net with input from ' is a directed acyclic graph G with an ordered 
sequence of n source nodes (called inputs) and one sink (called the output). Nodes 
of G that are not source nodes axe called computation nodes, nodes that are neither 
source nor sink nodes are called hidden nodes. With each computation node nl 
there is associated a function fi: i,deg, ee(,,) __ {--1, +1}, where indeg'ee(ni) is 
the number of incoming edges for node hi. With the net itself there is associated 
a function f: ' -- {-1, +1} defined by composing the ffs in the obvious way, 
assuming that component i of the input $ is placed at the i th input node. 
A feedforward architecture is a class of feedforwaxd nets all of which share the 
same underlying graph. Given a graph G we define a feedforward axchitecture by 
associating to each computation node ni a class of functions Fi from 
It should be noted that our bounds differ significantly from those given in [dev88] in 
that the latter exhibit a dependence on the inverse of e '. This is because we derive 
our results from Vapnik's theorem on the uniform relative deviation of frequencies 
from their probabilities ([vap82], see Appendix A3 of [behw87b]), giving sharper 
bounds as e approaches 0.

to (-1, -{-1. The resulting architecture consists of all feedforward nets obtained by 
choosing a particular function ft from Ft for each computation node nt. We will 
identify an architecture with the class of functions computed by the individual nets 
withi the architecture when no confusion will arise. 
CONDITIONS SUFFICIENT FOR VALID 
GENERALIZATION 
Theorem 1: Let F be a feedforward architecture generated by an underlying 
graph G with N _ 2 computation nodes and Ft be the class of functions associated 
with computation node nt of G, 1 _ i _ N. Let d -- i=x VCdim(Ft). Then 
a(.) < HV=x a,(,) < (re,Vd) d for . _> d, where e is the base of the natural 
logarithm. 
Proof: Assume G has n input nodes and that the computation nodes of G are 
ordered so that node nt receives inputs only from input nodes and from computation 
nodes nj, 1 _ j _ i- 1. Let S be a set ofrn points in '. The dichotomy 
induced on S by the function in node nx can be chosen in at most Az,, (m) ways. 
This choice determines the input to node n. for each of the rn points in S. The 
dichotomy induced on these m inputs by the function in node n. can be chosen 
in at most Ai 2 (m) ways, etc. Any dichotomy of S induced by the whole network 
can be obtained by choosing dichotomies for each of the ni's in this manner, hence 
n(") < H,=, n,("). 
By a theorem of Sauer [sau72], whenever Vealira(if) = k < oo, Xr(m) < (era/k)  
for all m _ k (see also [behw87b]). Let d/ = VCTdirn(Ft), 1 _ i _ N. Thus 
d = 2,, d. Then Ill=, n,(") < H,=x(e-/) for . >_ d. Usins the fact that 
= --atlogat _ logN whenever al > 0, 1 < i < N, and i=x at = 1, and setting 
', > (d/r)'. Hence II=(e,ld,)" < 
at = eli/d, it is easily verified that Hiff= x _ _ 
(Ve,,ld) . 
Corollary 2: Let F be the class of all functions computed by feedforward nets 
defined on a fixed underlying graph G with E edges and N _ 2 computation 
nodes, each of which computes a linear threshold function. Let W = E + N (the 
total number of weights in the network, including one weight per edge and one 
threshold per computation node). hen (,) < (re,,/w) w for all . _> W and 
VC'dim(F) _ 2Wlog(eN). 
Proof: The first inequality follows from directly from Theorem 1 using the fact that 
VCdirn(F) = k + 1 when F is the class of all linear threshold functions on  (see 
e.g. [wd81]). For the second inequality, it is easily verified that for N _ 2 and 
m = 2Wlog(elV), (rem/W) w < 2 ". Hence this is an upper bound on ¾½dim(ff). 
Using VC dimension bounds given in [wd81], related corollaries can be obtained for 
nets that use spherical and other types of polynomial threshold functions. These 
bounds can be used in the following. 
What Size Net Gives Valid Generalization? 85 
Theorem 3 [vap82] (see [behw87b], Theorem A3.3): Let F be a class of functions  
on !R ', 0 <  _ 1, 0 < e, 5  1. Let S be a random sequence of rn examples drawn 
independently according to the distribution D. The probability that there exists a 
function in F that disagrees with at most a fraction (1 - )e of the examples in S 
and yet has error greater than e (w.r.t. D) is less than 
8A v( 2m)e-'? m/ 4. 
From Corollary 2 and Theorem 3, we get: 
Corollary 4: Given a fixed graph G with E edges and N linear threshold units 
(i.e. W = E + N weights), fixed 0 < e _ 1/2, and m random training examples, 
where 
m _> 32W In 32N, 
if one can find a choice of weights so that at least a fraction 1- e/2 of the m training 
examples are correctly loaded, then one has confidence at least 1 - 8e -l'sw that 
the net will correctly classify all but a fraction ß of future examples drawn from the 
same distribution. For 
m _ 64Wln64Ar, 
the confidence is at least 1 - 8e -'n/aa. 
Proof: Let , = 1/2 and apply Theorem 3, using the bound on Aid(m) given in 
Corollary 2. This shows that the probability that there exists a choice of the weights 
that defines a function with error greater than e that is consistent with at least a 
fraction 1 - e/2 of the training examples is at most 
8(2Ar ern/W) W e-r/ia. 
When rn = -. -,,--, this is 8(2e which is less than 8e -l'sW for N > 
a"Y l , _ 
ana 5 Whe= Z 5 
e-m/16  8e-m/a2. 
The constant 32 is undoubtably an overestimate. No serious attempt has been made 
to minimize it. Further, we do not know if the log term is unavoidable. Nevertheless, 
even without these terms, for nets with many weights this may represent a consid- 
erable number of examples. Such nets are common in cases where the complexity 
of the rule being learned is not known in advance, so a large architecture is chosen 
We assume some measurability conditions on the class F. See [po184], [behw87b] for 
details. 
86 Baum and Haussler 
in order to increase the chances that the rule can be represented. To counteract the 
concomitant increase in the size of the training sample needed, one method that 
has been explored is the use of learning algorithms that try to use as little of the 
architecture as possible to load the examples, e.g. by setting as many weights to 
zero as possible, and by removing as many nodes as possible (a node can be removed 
if all its incoming weights are zero.) [rum87] [hin87]. The following shows that the 
VC dimension of such a "reduced" architecture is not much larger than what one 
would get if one knew a priori what nodes and edges could be deleted. 
Corollary 5: Let F be the class of all functions computed by linear threshold 
feedforward nets defined on a fixed underlying graph G with N' _> 2 computation 
nodes and E ' >_ N * edges, such that at most E _> 2 edges have non-zero weights 
and at most N >_ 2 nodes have at least one incoming edge with a non-zero weight. 
Let W - E + N. Then the conclusion of Corollary 4 holds for sample size 
rn  32W. ln32NE. 
Proof sketch: We can bound Az,(rn) by considering the number of ways the N nodes 
and E edges that remain can be chosen from among those in the initial network. A 
crude upper bound is (N')V(E') . Applying Corollary 2 to the remaining network 
gives At(m) <_ (N')N(E')r(Nem/W) W. This is at most (NE'ern/W) W. The rest 
of the analysis is similar to that in Corollary 4. 
This indicates that minimizing non-zero weights may be a fruitful approach. Similar 
approaches in other learning contexts are discussed in [hau88] and [lit88]. 
CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR 
VALID GENERALIZATION 
The following general theorem gives a lower bound on the number of examples 
needed for distribution-free learning, regardless of the algorithm used. 
Theorem 6 [ehkv87] (see also [behwS7b]): Let F be a class of {-1,-t-1}-valued 
functions on " with VC'dirn(F) _> 2. Let A be any learning algorithm that takes 
as input a sequence of {-1, +l}-labeled examples over !R" and produces as output 
a function from !R" into {-1, +1}. Then for any 0 < e <_ 1/8, 0 <  _< --- and 
m < rnaz[ .1 --e inl, VC'dim(F)- 1 
e 32e ']' 
there exists (1) a function f  F and (2) a distribution D on !R" x {-1, +1} for 
which Prob((:,a): a  f()) = 0, such that given a random sample of size m 
chosen according to D, with probability at least 5, A produces a function with error 
greater than e. 
What Size Net Gives Valid Generalization? 87 
This theorem can be used to obtain a lower bound on the number of examples 
needed to train a net, assuming that the examples are drawn from the worst-case 
distribution that is consistent with some function realizable on that net. We need 
only obtain lower bounds on the VC dimension of the associated architecture. In 
this section we will specialize by considering only fully-connected networks of linear 
threshold units that have only one hidden layer. Thus each hidden node will have an 
incoming edge from each input node and an outgoing edge to the output node, and 
no other edges will be present. In [b88] a slicing construction is given that shows 
that a one hidden lay. er net of threshold units with n inputs and 2j hidden units 
can shatter an arbitrary set of 2in vectors in general position in '. A corollary of 
this result is: 
Theorem 7: The class of one hidden layer linear threshold nets taking input from 
' with k hidden units has VC dimension at least 2 [J n. 
Note that for large k and n, 2 [Jn is approximately equal to the total number W 
of weights in the network. 
A special case of considerable interest occurs when the domain is restricted to 
the hypercube: -1,-1 '. Lemma 6 of [lit88] shows that the class of Boolean. 
functions on (--1,-1 ' represented by disjunctive normal form expressions with k 
terms, k < O(2'/'/'), where each term is the conjunction of n/2 literals, has 
VC dimension at least kn/4. Since these functions can be represented on a linear 
threshold net with one hidden layer of k units, this provides a lower bound on the 
VC dimension of this architecture. We also can use the slicing construction of [b88] 
to give a lower bound approaching kn/2. The actual result is somewhat stronger in 
that it shows that for large n a randomly chosen set of approximately kn/2 vectors 
is shattered with high probability. 
Theorem 8: With probability approaching 1 exponentially in n, a set S ofrn _ 2 '/s 
vectors chosen randomly and uniformly from (-1,-1 ' can be shattered by the 
one hidden layer architecture with 2[rn/[(,(1- 0 
.r-.))]] linear threshold units in 
its hidden layer. 
Proof sketch: With probability approaching 1 exponentially in n no pair of vectors 
in S are negations of each other. Assume n > e ø. Let r - In(1 
- ,7 ,')]' Divide 
S at random into [m/r] disjoint subsets S1, ..., S[,/,] each containing no more 
than r vectors. We will describe a set T of 4-1 vectors as sliceable if the vectors 
in T are linearly independent and the subspace they span over the reals does not 
contain any 4-1 vector other than the vectors in T and their negations. In [od188] 
it is shown, for large n, that any random set of r vectors has probability P -- 
4()()" +O(()") of not being sliceable. Thus the probability that some $, is not 
sliceable is O(rnn'()), which is exponentially small for rn _< 2"/s. Hence with 
probability approaching 1 exponentially in n, each S is sliceable, 
Consider any Boolean function f on S and let S + = (5  S : 
88 Baum and Haussler 
1 _ i _ rn/']. If St is sliceable and no pair of vectors in S are negations of each 
other then we may pass a plane through the points in Sf that doesn't contain any 
other points in S. Shifting this plane parallel to itself slightly we can construct two 
half spaces whose intersection forms a slice of ' containing S. + and no other points 
$ 
in S. Using threshold units at the hidden layer recognizing these two half spaces, 
with weights to the output unit +1 and -1 appropriately, the output unit receives 
input +2 for any point in the slice and 0 for any point not in the slice. Doing this 
for each Sf and thresholding at 1 implements the function f. 
We can now apply Theorem 6 to show that any neural net learning algorithm using 
too few examples will be fooled by some reasonable distributions. 
Corollary 9: For any learning algorithm training a net with k linear threshold 
functions in its hidden layer, and 0 < e _ 1/8, if the algorithm uses (a) fewer 
than 2Lk/2J,- examples to learn a function from R ' to f-l,+l, or (b) fewer 
32 
than L'Lk/2J('n(x/2'x-ø/(l ")))J- examples to learn a function from f-I, +1 ' 
32 
to f-l, +1, for k _< 0(2/), then there exist distributions D for which (i) there 
exists a choice of weights such that the network exactly classifies its inputs according 
to D, but (ii) the learning algorithm will have probability at least .01 of finding a 
choice of weights which in fact has error greater than e. 
CONCLUSION 
We have given theoretical lower and upper bounds on the sample size rs. net 
size needed such that valid generalization can be expected. The exact constants we 
have given in these formulae are still quite crude; it may be expected that the actual 
values are closer to 1. The logarithmic factor in Corollary 4 may also not be needed, 
at least for the types of distributions and architectures seen in practice. Widrow's 
experience supports this conjecture [wid87]. However, closing the theoretical gap 
sample size for architectures with one hidden layer of threshold units remains an 
interesting open problem. Also, apart from our upper bound, the case of multiple 
hidden layers is largely open. Finally, our bounds are obtained under the assumption 
that the node functions are linear threshold functions (or at least Boolean valued). 
We conjecture that similar bounds also hold for classes of real valued functions such 
as sigmoid functions, and hope shortly to establish this.
