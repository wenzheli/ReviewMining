Abstract 
The most commonly used neural network models are not well suited 
to direct digital implementations because each node needs to per- 
form a large number of operations between floating point values. 
Fortunately, the ability to learn from examples and to generalize is 
not restricted to networks of this type. Indeed, networks where each 
node implements a simple Boolean function (Boolean networks) can 
be designed in such a way as to exhibit similar properties. Two 
algorithms that generate Boolean networks from examples are pre- 
sented. The results show that these algorithms generalize very 
well in a class of problems that accept compact Boolean network 
descriptions. The techniques described are general and can be ap- 
plied to tasks that are not known to have that characteristic. Two 
examples of applications are presented: image reconstruction and 
hand-written character recognition. 
I Introduction 
The main objective of this research is the design of algorithms for empirical learning 
that generate networks suitable for digital implementations. Although threshold 
gate networks can be implemented using standard digital technologies, for many 
applications this approach is expensive and inefficient. Pulse stream modulation 
[Murray and Smith, 1988] is one possible approach, but is limited to a relatively 
small number of neurons and becomes slow if high precision is required. Dedicated 
911 
912 Oliveira and Sangiovanni-Vincentelli 
boards based on DSP processors can achieve very high performance and are very 
flexible but may be too expensive for some applications. 
The algorithms described in this paper accept as input a training set and generate 
networks where each node implements a relatively simple Boolean function. Such 
networks will be called Boolean networks. Many applications can benefit from 
such an approach because the speed and compactness of digital implementations 
is still unmatched by its analog counterparts. Additionally, many alternatives are 
available to designers that want to implement Boolean networks, from full-custom 
design to field programmable gate arrays. This makes the digital alternative more 
cost effective than solutions based on analog designs. 
Occam's razor [Blumer e! al., 1987; Rissanen, 1986] provides the theoretical founda- 
tion for the development of algorithms that can be used to obtain Boolean networks 
that generalize well. According to this paradigm, simpler explanations for the avail- 
able data have higher predictive power. The induction problem can therefore be 
posed as an optimization problem: given a labeled training set derive the 
less complex Boolean network that is consistent  with the training set. 
Occam's razor, however, doesn't help in the choice of the particular way of mea- 
suring complexity that should be used. In general, different types of problems may 
require different complexity measures. The algorithms described in section 3.1 and 
3.2 are greedy algorithms that aim at minimizing one specific complexity measure: 
the size of the overall network. Although this particular way of measuring com- 
plexity may prove inappropriate in some cases, we believe the approach proposed 
can be generalized and used with minor modifications in many other tasks. The 
problem of finding the smallest Boolean network consistent with the training set is 
NP-hard [Garey and Johnson, 1979] and cannot be solved exactly in most cases. 
Heuristic approaches like the ones described are therefore required. 
2 Definitions 
We consider the problem of supervised learning in an attribute based description 
language. The attributes (input variables) are assumed to be Boolean and every 
exemplar in the training set is labeled with a value that describes its class. Both 
algorithms try to maximize the mutual information between the network output 
and these labels. 
Let variable X take the values {z, z2, ...z,} with probabilities p(z),p(z2)...p(z,). 
The entropy of X is given by H(X) - -j p(cj)logp(cj) and is a measure 
of the uncertainty about the value of X. The uncertainty about the value 
of X when the value of another variable Y is known is given by H(XIY ) - 
-- i P(Yi ) Ej P( Xj lYi ) log p( xj lYi ). 
The amount by which the uncertainty of X is reduced when the value of variable Y 
is known, I(Y,X) - H(X) - H(XIY) is called the mutual information between Y 
and X. In this context, Y will be a variable defined by the output of one or more 
nodes in the network and X will be the target value specified in the training set.

3 Algorithms 
3.1 Muesli - An algorithm for the design of nmlti-level logic networks 
This algorithm derives the Boolean network by performing gradient descent in the 
mutual information between a set of nodes and the target values specified by the 
labels in the training set. 
In the pseudo code description of the algorithm given in figure 1, the function 
computes the mutual information between the nodes in S (viewed as a multi-valued 
variable) and the target output.

nlist .- nlist t_J f; 
return(TRUE); 
else return(FALSE); 
Figure 1: Pseudo-code for the Muesli algorithm. 
The algorithm works by keeping a list of candidate nodes, nlist, that initially con- 
tains only the primary inputs. The act variable selects which node in nlist is active. 
Initially, act is set to 1 and the node that provides more information about the out- 
put is selected as the active node. Function improve_mi() tries to combine the 
active node with other nodes as to increase the mutual information. 
Except for very simple functions, a point will be reached where no further improve- 
914 Oliveira and Sangiovanni-Vincentelli 
merits can be made for the single most informative node. The value of act is then 
increased (up to a pre-specified maximum) and improve_rot is again called to select 
auxiliary features using other nodes in nlist as the active node. If this fails, the 
value of sup (size of the support of each selected function) is increased until no 
further improvements are possible or the target is reached. 
The function sort_nlist_by_T(nlist, act) sorts the first act nodes in the list by de- 
creasing value of the information they provide about the labels. More explicitly, the 
first node in the sorted list is the one that provides maximal information about the 
labels. The second node is the one that will provide more additional information 
after the first has been selected and so on. 
Function improve_rot() calls best_function(nlist, act,sup) to select the Boolean 
function f that takes as inputs node nlist[act] plus sup-1 other nodes and maximizes 
I(nlist[1: act- 1] U f). When sup is larger than 2 it is unfeasible to search all 22p 
possible functions to select the desired one. However, given sup input variables, 
finding such a function is equivalent to selecting a partition 2 of the 2 sup points in 
the input space that maximizes a specific cost function. This partition is found using 
the Kernighan-Lin algorithm [Kernighan and Lin, 1970] for graph-partitioning. 
Figure 2 exemplifies how the algorithm works when learning the simple Boolean 
function f - ab + cde from a complete training set. In this example, the value of 
sup is always at 2. Therefore, only 2 input Boolean functions arc generated.

3.2 Fulfringe - a network generation algorithm based on decision trees 
This algorithm uses binary decision trees [Quinlan, 1986] as the basic underlying 
representation. A binary decision tree is a rooted, directed, acyclic graph, where 
each terminal node (a node witl no outgoing edges) is labeled with one of the 
possible output labels and each non-terminal node has exactly two outgoing edges 
labeled 0 and 1. Each non-terminal node is also labeled with the name of the 
attribute that is tested at that node. A decision tree can be used to classify a 
particular example by starting at the root node and taking, until a terminal is 
reached, the edge labeled with the value of the attribute tested at the current node. 
Decision trees are usually built in a greedy way. At each step, the algorithm greedily 
selects the attribute to be tested as the one that provides maximal informa6on about 
the label of the examples that reached that node in the decision tree. It then recurs 
after splitting these examples according to the value of the tested attribute. 
Fulltinge works by identifying patterns near the fringes of the decision tree and 
using them to build new features. The idea was first proposed in [Pagallo and 
Haussler, 1990].

Figure 3: Fringe patterns identified by fulfringe 
Figure 3 shows the patterns that fulfringe identifies. Dcfringe, proposed in [Yang 
el al., 1991], identifies the patterns shown in the first two rows. These patterns 
correspond to 8 Boolean functions of 2 variables. Since there are only 10 distinct 
Boolean functions that depend on two va.riables 3, it is natural to add the patterns 
in the third row and identify all possible functions of 2 variables. As in ticfringe 
and fringe, these new composite features are added (if they have not yet been 
generated) to the list of available features and a new decision tree is built. The

916 Oliveira and Sangiovanni-Vincentelli 
process is iterated until a decision tree with ouly one decisiou node is built. The 
attribute tested at this node is a complex feature and can be viewed as the output 
of a Boolean network that matches the training set data. 
3.3 Encoding nmltivalued outputs 
Both muesli and fulfringe generate Boolean networks with a single binary valued 
output. When the target label can have more than 2 values, some encoding must be 
used. The prefered solution is to encode the outputs using an error correcting code 
[Dietterich and Bakiri, 1991]. This approach preserves most of the compactness of 
a digital encoding while beeing much less sensitive to errors in one of the output 
variables. Additionally, the Hamming distance between an observed output and the 
closest valid codeword gives a measure of the certainty of the classification. This 
can be used to our advantage in problems where a failure to classify is less serious 
than the output of a wrong classification. 
4 Performance evaluation 
To evaluate the algorithms, we selected a set of 11 functions of variable complexity. 
A complete description of these finctions can be found in [Oliveira, 1994]. The first 
6 functions were proposed as test cases in [Pagallo and Haussler, 1990] and accept 
compact disjoint normal form descriptions. The remaining ones accept compact 
multi-level representations but have large two level descriptions. The algorithms 
described in sections 3.1 and 3.2 were compared with the cascade-correlation algo- 
rithm [Fahlman and Lebiere, 1990] and a standard decision tree algorithm analog 
to ID3 [Quinlan, 1986]. As in [Pagallo and Haussler, 1990], the nmnber of examples 
1 
in the training set was selected to be equal to 7 times the description length of the 
function under a fixed encoding scheme, where e was set equal to 0.1. For each 
function, 5 training sets were randomly selected. The average accuracy for the 5 
runs in an independent set of 4000 examples is listed in table 1.

The results show that the performance of muesli and fulltinge is consistently su- 
Learning Complex Boolean Functions: Algorithms and Applications 917 
perior to the other two algorithms. Muesli performs poorly in examples that have 
many xor functions, duc the greedy nature of the algorithm. In particular, muesli 
failed to find a solution in the alloted time for 4 of the 5 runs of or5_32 and found 
the exact solution in only one of the runs. 
ID3 was the fastest of the algorithms and C, ascadc-Corrclation the slowest. Fulfringe 
and muesli exhibited similar running times for these tasks. Wc observed, however, 
that for larger problems the runtime for fulfring½ becomes prohibitively high and 
mu½sli is comparatively much faster. 
5 Applications 
To evaluate the techniques described in real problems, experiments were performed 
in two domains: noisy image reconstruction and handwritten character recognition. 
The main objective was to investigate whether the approach is applicable to prob- 
lems that are not known to accept a compact Boolean network representation. The 
outputs were encoded using a 15 bit Hadamard error correcting code. 
5.1 hnage reconstruction 
The speed required by applications in image processing makes it a very interesting 
field for this type of approach. In this experiment, 16 level gray scale images wcrc 
corrupted by random noise by switching each bit with 5% probability. Samples of 
this image wcrc used to train a network in the reconstruction of the original image. 
The training set consisted of 5x5 pixel regions of corrupted images (100 binary 
variables per sample) labeled with the value of the center pixel. Figure 4 shows a 
detail of the reconstruction performed in an independent test image by the network 
obtained using fulfringe.

5.2 Handwritten character recognition 
The NIST database of handwritten characters was used for this task. Individually 
segmented digits were normalized to a 16 by 16 binary grid. A set of 53629 digits 
was used for training and the resulting network was tested in a different set of 52467 
918 Oliveira and Sangiovanni-Vincentelli 
digits. Training was performed using muesli. The algorithm was stopped after a pre- 
specified time (48 hours on a DECstation 5000/260) ellapsed. The resulting network 
was placed and routed using the TimberWolf [Sechen and Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, 
1986] package and occupies an area of 78.8 sq. ram. using 0.8/ technology. 
The accuracy on the test set was 93.9%. This value compares well with the per- 
formance obtained by alternative approaches that use a similarly sized training set 
and little domain knowledge, but fails short of the best results published so far. 
Ongoing research on this problem is concentrated on the use of domain knowledge 
to restrict the search for compact networks and speed up the training.
