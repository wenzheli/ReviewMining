ABSTRACT 
In order to detect the presence and location of immunoglobu- 
lin (Ig) domains from amino acid sequences we built a system 
based on a neural network with one hidden layer trained with 
back propagation. The program was designed to efficiently 
identify proteins exhibiting such domains, characterized by a 
few localized conserved regions and a low overall homology. 
When the National Biomedical Research Foundation (NBRF) 
NEW protein sequence database was scanned to evaluate the 
program's performance, we obtained very low rates of false 
negatives coupled with a moderate rate of false positives. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Two amino acid sequences from proteins are homologous if they can be 
aligned so that many corresponding amino acids are identical or have similar 
chemical properties. Such subsequences (domains) often exhibit similar three 
dimensional structure. Furthemore, sequence similarity often results from 
common ancestors. Immunoglobulin (Ig) domains are sets of/-sheets bound 
424 Bengio, Bengio, Pouliot and Agin 
by cysteine bonds and with a characteristic tertiary structure. Such domains 
are found in many proteins involved in immune, cell adhesion and receptor 
functions. These proteins collectively form the immunoglobulin superfamily 
(for review, see Williams and Barclay, 1987). Members of the superfamily 
often possess several Ig domains. These domains are characterized by well- 
conserved groups of amino acids localized to specific subregions. Other resi- 
dues outside of these regions are often poorly conserved, such that there is 
low overall homology between Ig domains, even though they are clearly 
members of the same superfamily. 
Current search programs incorporating algorithms such as the Wilbur-Lipman 
algorithm (1983) or the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (1970) and its modifica- 
tion by Smith and Waterman (1981) are ill-designed for detecting such 
domains because they implicitly consider each amino acid to be equally im- 
portant. This is not the case for residues within domains such as the Ig 
domain, since only some amino acids are well conserved, while most are vari- 
able. One solution to this problem are search algorithms based upon the sta- 
tistical occurrence of a residue at a particular position (Wang et al., 1989; 
Gribskov et al., 1987). The Profile Analysis set of programs published by the 
University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (Devereux et al., 1984) 
rely upon such an algorithm. Although Profile Analysis can be applied to 
search for domains (c.f. Blaschuk, Pouliot & Holland 1990), the output from 
these programs often suffers from a high rate of false negatives and positives. 
Variations in domain length are handled using the traditional method of penal- 
ties proportional to the number of gaps introduced, their length and their po- 
sition. This approach entails a significant amount of spurious recognition if 
there is considerable variation in domain length to be accounted for. 
We have chosen to address these problems by training a neural network to 
recognize accepted Ig domains. Perceptrons and various types of neural net- 
works have been used previously in biological research with various degrees of 
success (cf. Stormo et al., 1982; Qian and Sejnowski, 1988). Our results sug- 
gest that they are well suited for detecting relatively cryptic sequence patterns 
such as those which characterize Ig domains. Because the design and training 
procedure described below is relatively simple, network-based search pro- 
grams constitute a valid solution to problems such as searching for proteins 
assembled from the duplication of a domain. 
2 ALGORITHM, NETWORK DESIGN AND TRAINING 
The network capitalizes upon data concerning the existence and localization 
of highly conserved groups of amino acids characteristic of the Ig domain. Its 
design is similar in several respects to neural networks we have used in the 
study of speech recognition (Bengio et al., 1989). Four conserved subregions 
(designated P1-P4) of the Ig domain homology were identified. These roughly 
correspond to /-strands B, C, E and F, respectively, of the Ig domain (see 
also Williams and Barclay, 1988). Amino acids in these four groups are not 
necessarily all conserved, but for each subregion they show a distribution very 
different from the distribution generally observed elsewhere in these proteins. 
Hence the first and most important stage of the system learns about these 
joint distributions. The program scans proteins using a window of 5 residues. 
A Neural Network to Detect Homologies in Proteins 425 
The first stage of the system consists of a 2-layer feedforward neural network 
(5 X 20 inputs - 8 hidden - 4 outputs; see Figure 1) trained with back propaga- 
tion (Rumelhart et al., 1986). Better results were obtained for the recognition 
of these conserved regions with this architecture than without hidden layer 
(similar to a perceptron). The second stage evaluates, based upon the stream 
of outputs generated by the first stage, whether and where a region similar to 
the Ig domain has been detected. This stage currently uses a simple dynamic 
programming algorithm, in which constraints about order of subregions and 
distance between them are explicitly programmed. We force the recognizer to 
detect a sequence of high values (above a threshold) for the four conserved 
regions, in the correct order and such that the sum of the values obtained at 
the four recognized regions is greater than a certain threshold. Weak penalties 
are applied for violations of distance constraints between conserved subre- 
gions (e.g., distance between P1 and P2, P2 and P3, etc) based upon simple 
rules derived from our analysis of Ig domains. These rules have little impact if 
strong homologies are detected, such that the program easily handles the large 
variation in domain size exhibited by Ig domains. It was necessary to explicit- 
ly formMate these constraints given the low number of training examples as 
well as the assumption that the distance between groups is not a critical 
discriminating factor. We have assumed that inter-region subsequences prob- 
ably do not significantly influence discrimination.

Figure 2: Sample output from a search of NEW. Ig domains 
present within the constant region of an epsilon Ig chain 
(NBRF file number A22771) are listed with the position of 
P1-P4 (see text). The overall score for each domain is also list- 
ed. 
As a training set we used a group of 30 proteins comprising bona fide Ig 
domains (Williams and Barclay, 1987). In order to increase the size of the 
training set, additional sequences were stochastically generated by substituting 
residues which are not in critical positions of the domain. These substitutions 
were designed not to affect the local distribution of residues to minimize 
changes in the overall chemical character of the region. 
The program was evaluated and optimized by scanning the NBRF protein da- 
tabases (PROTEIN and NEW) version 19. Results presented below are based 
upon searches of the NEW database (except where otherwise noted) and were 
generated with a cutoff value of 3.0. Only complete sequences from ver- 
tebrates, insects (including Drosophila melanogaster) and eukaryotic viruses 
were scanned. This corresponds to 2422 sequences out of the 4718 present in 
the NEW database. Trial runs with the program indicated that a cutoff thres- 
hold of between 2.7 and 3.0 eliminates the vast majority of false positives with 
little effect upon the rate of false negatives. A sample output is listed in Fig- 
ure 2. 
3 RESULTS 
When the NEW protein sequence database of NBRF was searched as 
described above, 191 proteins were identified to possess at least one Ig 
domain. A scan of the 4718 proteins comprising the NEW database required 
an average of 20 hours of CPU time on a VAX 11/780. This is comparable to 
other computationally intensive programs (e.g., Profile Analysis). When run 
on a SUN 4 computer, similar searches required 1.3 hours of CPU time. This 
is sufficiently fast to allow the user to alter the cutoff threshold repeatedly 
when searching for proteins with low homology.

The vast majority of proteins which scored above 3.0 were of human, mouse, 
rat or rabbit origin. A few viral and insect proteins also scored above the 
threshold. All proteins in the training set and present in either the NEW or 
PROTEIN databases were detected. Proteins detected in the NEW database 
are listed in Table I and sorted according to score. Even though only human 
MHC class I and II were included in the training set, both mouse H-2 class I 
and II were detected. Bovine and rat transplantation antigens were also 
detected. These proteins are homologs of human MHC's. For proteins which 
include more than one Ig domain contiguously arranged (e.g., carcinoem- 
bryonic antigen), all domains were detected if they were sufficiently well con- 
served. However, domains lacking a feature or possessing a degenerate 
feature scored much lower (usually below 3.0) such that they are not recog- 
nized when using a threshold value of 3. Recognition of human and mouse im- 
munoglobulin sequences was used to measure recognition efficiency. The rate 
of false negatives for immunoglobulins was very low for both species (Table 
II). Table III lists the 13 proteins categorized as false positives detected when 
searching with a threshold of 3.0. Relative to the total number of domains 
detected, this corresponds to a false positive rate of 6.8%. In the strict sense 
some of these proteins are not false positives because they do exhibit the ex- 
pected features of the Ig domain in the correct order. However, inter-feature

distances for these pseudo-domains are very different from those observed in 
bona fide Ig domains. Proteins which are rich in/-sheets, such as rat sodium 
channel II and fruit-fly NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 1 are also 
abundant among the set of false positives. This is not surprising since the Ig 
domain is composed of/-strands. One solution to this problem lies in the use 
of a larger training set as well as the addition of a more intelligent second 
stage designed to evaluate inter-feature distances so as to increase the specifi- 
city of detection.

5 DISCUSSION 
The detection of specific protein domains is becoming increasingly important 
since many proteins are constituted of a succession of domains. Unfortunate- 
ly, domains (Ig or otherwise) are often only weakly homologous with each 
other. We have designed a neural network to detect proteins which comprise 
Ig domains to evaluate this approach in helping to solve this problem. Alter- 
natives to neural network-based search programs exist. Search programs can 
be designed to recognize the flanking Cys-termini regions to the exclusion of 
other domain features since these flanks are the best conserved features of Ig 
domains (cf. Wang et al., 1989). However, even Cys-termini can exhibit poor 
overall homology and therefore generate statistically insignificant homology 
scores when analyzed with the ALIGN program (NBRF) (cf. Williams and 
Barclay, 1987). Other search programs (such as Profile Analysis) cannot effi- 
ciently handle the large variations in domain size exhibited by the Ig domain 
(mostly comprised between 45 and 70 residues). Search results become cor- 
rupted by high rates of false positives and negatives. Since the size of the 
NBRF protein databases increases considerably each year, the problem of 
false positives promises to become crippling if these rates are not substantially 
decreased. In view of these problems we have found the application of a 
neural network to the detection of Ig domains to be an advantageous solution. 
As the state of biological knowledge advances, new Ig domains can be added 
to the training set and training resumed. They can learn the statistical features

of the conserved subregions that permit detection of an Ig domain and gen- 
eralize to new examples of this domain that have a similar distribution. Previ- 
ously unrecognized and possibly degenerate homologous sequences are there- 
fore likely to be detected.
