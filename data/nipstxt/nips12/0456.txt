Abstract 
Transduction is an inference principle that takes a training sam- 
ple and aims at estimating the values of a function at given points 
contained in the so-called working sample as opposed to the whole 
of input space for induction. Transduction provides a confidence 
measure on single predictions rather than classifiers -- a feature 
particularly important for risk-sensitive applications. The possibly 
infinite number of functions is reduced to a finite number of equiv- 
alence classes on the working sample. A rigorous Bayesian analysis 
reveals that for standard classification loss we cannot benefit from 
considering more than one test point at a time. The probability 
of the label of a given test point is determined as the posterior 
measure of the corresponding subset of hypothesis space. We con- 
sider the PAC setting of binary classification by linear discriminant 
functions (perceptrons) in kernel space such that the probability of 
labels is determined by the volume ratio in version space. We 
suggest to sample this region by an ergodic billiard. Experimen- 
tal results on real world data indicate that Bayesian Transduction 
compares fa-vourably to the well-known Support Vector Machine, 
in particular if the posterior probability of labellings is used as a 
confidence measure to exclude test points of low confidence. 
I Introduction 
According to Vapnik [9], when solving a given problem one should avoid solving a 
more 9eneral problem as an intermediate step. The reasoning behind this principle is 
that in order to solve the more general task resources may be wasted or compromises 
may have to be made which would not have been necessary for the solution of the 
problem at hand. A direct application of this common-sense principle reduces the 
more general problem of inferring a functional dependency on the whole of input 
space to the problem of estimating the values of a function at given points (working 
sample), a paradigm referred to as transductive inference. More formally, given a 
probability measure Px¾ on the space of data l' x y = 2c' x {-1, +1}, a training 
sample $ = {(x, y),..., (xt, yt)} is generated i.i.d. according to Px¾. Additional 
m data points W - {xl+,... ,xl+,} are drawn: the working sample. The goal 
is to label the objects of the working sample W using a fixed set 7/ of functions

f : A'  {-1,+1} so as to minimise a predefined loss. In.contrast, inductive 
inference, aims at choosing a single function ft 7-I best suited to capture the 
dependency expressed by the unknown Px¾. Obviously, if we have a transductive 
algorithm .A (W, S, 7/) that assigns to each working sample W a set of labels given 
the training sample $ and the set 7/of functions, we can define a function fs: 2  
{- 1, + 1 } by fs (x) = A ({x}, $, 7/) as a result of the transduction algorithm. There 
are two crucial differences to induction, however: i) A ({x}, S, 7/) is not restricted 
to select a single decision function f E 7/for each x, ii) a transduction algorithm 
can give performance guarantees on particular labellings instead of functions. In 
practical applications this difference may be of great importance. 
After all, in risk sensitive applications (medical diagnosis, financial and critical 
control applications) it often matters to know how confident we are about a given 
prediction. In this case a general confidence measure of the classifier w.r.t. the 
whole input distribution would not provide the desired warranty at all. Note that 
for linear classifiers some guarantee can be obtained by the margin [7] which in 
Section 4 we will demonstrate to be too coarse a confidence measure. The idea of 
transduction was put forward in [8], where also first algorithmic ideas can be found. 
Later [1] suggested an algorithm for transduction based on linear programming and 
[3] highlighted the need for confidence measures in transduction. 
The paper is structured as follows: A Bayesian approach to transduction is formu- 
lated in Section 2. In Section 3 the function class of kernel perceptrons is introduced 
to which the Bayesian transduction scheme is applied. For the estimation of volumes 
in parameter space we present a kernel billiard as an efficient sampling technique. 
Finally, we demonstrate experimentally in Section 4 how the confidence measure 
for labellings helps Bayesian Transduction to achieve low generalisation error at a 
low rejection rate of test points and thus to outperform Support Vector Machines 
(SVMs). 
2 Bayesian Transductive Classification 
Suppose we are given a training sample $ = { (Xl, Vl),..., (xl, yl) ) drawn i.i.d. from 
Px¾ and a working sample W = {Xt+l,... ,xt+,} drawn i.i.d. from Px. Given 
a prior PH over the set 7 of functions and a likelihood P(x¾)tlH=! we obtain a 
def 
posterior probability PHi(X¾)t=S = PHIS by Bayes' rule. This posterior measure 
induces a probability measure on labellings b E {-1, +1} " of the working sample 
by I 
PY'"IS,W (b) dej PHIS ({f' Vx+i  W f (x+i) = hi}) ß 
(1) 
For the sake of simplicity let us assume a PAC style setting, i.e. there exists a 
function f* in the space 7 such that P¾1x=x (Y) = 5 (y - f* (x)). In this case one 
can define the so-called version-space as the set of functions that is consistent with 
the training sample 
V($)={f:V(xi,yi)eS f(xi)=yi}, (2) 
outside which the posterior Psis vanishes. Then PY"lS,W (b) represents the prior 
measure of functions consistent with the training sample $ and the labelling b 
on the working sample W normalised by the prior measure of functions consistent 
with $ alone. The measure PH can be used to incorporate prior knowledge into 
Note that the number of different labellings b implementable by 7/is bounded above 
by the value of the growth function IIt (IWl) [8, p. 321].

the inference process. If no such knowledge is available, considerations of symmetry 
may lead to "uninformative" priors. 
Given the measure P¾,qs,w over labellings, in order to arrive at a risk minimal 
decision w.r.t. the labelling we need to define a loss function I: ym x ym  IR+ 
between labellings and minimise its expectation, 
/ (b, $, W) - EYlS,W It (b, Y")] =  l (b, b') PYlS,W (b'), (3) 
{b'} 
where the summation runs over all the 2 " possible labellings b  of the working 
sample. Let us consider two scenarios: 
1. A 0-I-loss on the exact labelling b, i.e. for two labellings b and b  
/½(b,b')=l-l-IS(bi-b)  R½(b,S,W)= l-P¾.s,w(b) . (4) 
i=1 
In this case choosing the labelling be = argmin b Re (b, $, W) of the highest 
joint probability P¾"lS,W (b) minimises the risk. This non-labelwise loss is 
appropriate if the goal is to exactly identify a combination of labels, e.g. the 
combination of handwritten digits defining a postal zip code. Note that 
classical SVM transduction (see, e.g. [8, 1]) by maximising the margin on 
the combined training and working sample approximates this strategy and 
hence does not minimise the standard classification risk on single instances 
as intended. 
2. A 0-i-loss on the single labels bi, i.e. for two labellings b and b  
m 
/,(b,b') = ly(1-(bi-b)), (5) 
i=1 
m 
(b,S, W) = ñ - (0, - o',)) (b') 
i=1 {b,} 
- 
i=1 
Due to the independent treatment of the loss at working sample points the 
risk R, (b, S, W) is minimised by the labelling of highest marginal proba- 
bility of the labels, i.e. 
b = argmaxvey P.lS ({f: f (xt+i) = y)). 
Thus in the case of the labelwise loss (5) a working sample of m > 1 
point does not offer any advantages over larger working samples w.r.t. the 
Bayes-optimal decision. Since this corresponds to the standard classifica- 
tion setting, we will restrict ourselves to working samples of size m = 1, 
i.e. to one working point xt+l. 
3 Bayesian Transduction by Volume 
3.1 The Kernel Perceptron 
We consider transductive inference for the class of kernel perceptrons. The decision 
functions are given by 
f (x) = sign ((w,b (x))j,) = sign ctik (xi,x) w =  climb (xi) e ', 
i=1 i=1

classification toy example. Using the duality given by (w, b (x)}y = 0 data points 
on the left correspond to hyperplanes on the right, while hyperplanes on the left 
can be thought of as points on the right. 
where the mapping b: X  Y maps from input space X to a feature space  
completely determined by the inner product function (kernel) k : 2 x 2d   
(see [9, 10]). Given a training sample $ = {(xi,yi)}i=l we can define the version 
space -- the set of all perceptrons compatible with the training data -- as in (2) 
having the additional constraint Ilwll - i ensuring uniqueness. In order to obtain 
a prediction on the label bl of the working point Xl+l we note that Xl+l may 
bisects the volume V of version space into two sub-volumes V + and V-, where the 
perceptrons in V + would classify Xl+l as b = +1 and those in V- as b = -1. 
The ratio p+ = V+/V is the probability of the labelling b = +1 given a uniform 
prior P, over w and the class of kernel perceptrons, accordingly for bl = -1 (see 
Figure 1). Already Vapnik in [8, p. 323] noticed that it is troublesome to estimate 
sub-volumes of version space. As the solution to this problem we suggest to use a 
billiard algorithm. 
3.2 Kernel Billiard for Volume Estimation 
The method of playing billiard in version space was first introduced by Rujan [6] 
for the purpose of estimating its centre of mass and consequently refined and ex- 
tended to kernel spaces by [4]. For Bayesian Transduction the idea is to bounce 
the billiard ball in version space and to record how much time it spends in each 
of the sub-volumes of interest. Under the assumption of ergodicity [2] w.r.t. the 
uniform measure in the limit the accumulated flight times for each sub-volume are 
proportional to the sub-volume itself. 
Since the trajectory is located in  each position w and direction v of the ball can 
be expressed as linear combinations of the b (xi), i.e. 
w= v = 
i=1 i=1 i,j=l 
where c,/ are real vectors with œ components and fully determine the state of the 
billiard. The algorithm for the determination of the label b of Xt+l proceeds as 
follows: 
1. Initialise the starting position w0 in V (S) using any kernel perceptron 
algorithm that achieves zero training error (e.g. SVM [9]). Set V + = V- = 
0.

2. Find the closest boundary of V ($) starting from current w into direction 
v, where the flight times vj for all points including Xt+l are determined 
using 
The smallest positive flight time vc - minj:rs>0 vj in kernel space corre- 
sponds to the closest data point boundary  (xc) on the hypersphere. Note, 
that if vc   we randomly generate a direction v pointing towards version 
space, i.e. y(v,(x)) p 0 suming the lt bounce w at (x). 
3. Calculate the hall's new position w  according to 
w+rcv 
W t = 
IIw + 
Calculate the distance t = []w- W']]sphere = arccos (1- ]]w- w'[] 
on the hypersphere and add it to the volume estimate V corresponding to 
the current label V = sign ({w + w',0(xt+))). If the test point 0 (x+) 
w hit, i.e. e =  + 1, keep the old direction vector v. Otherwise update 
to the reflection direction v', 
v' = v- 2 (v, 0(xc)) 0 (xc). 
Go back to step 2 unless the stopping criterion (8) is met. 
Note that in practice one trajectory can be calculated in advance and can be used 
for all test points. The estimators of the probability of the labellings are then given 
by  = V+/(V + q- V-) and - = V-/(V + q- V-). Thus, the algorithm outputs 
b with confidence ctrans according to 
bl der 
= argmaxvy 'Y, (6) 
.. der (2 max( + -) 1)  [0,1]. (7) 
Ctrans -- . , -- 
Note that the Bayes Point Machine (BPM) [4] aims at an optimal approximation 
of the transductive classification (6) by a single function f E 7/ and that the well 
known SVM can be viewed as an approximation of the BPM by the centre of the 
largest ball in version space. Thus, treating the real valued output If(xl+x)l 4ef  
 Cind 
of SVM classifiers  a confidence measure can be considered an approximation of 
(7). The consequences will be demonstrated experimentally in the following section. 
Disregarding the issue of mixing time [2] and the dependence of trajectories we 
sume for the stopping criterion that the fraction p of time t spent in volume 
V + on trajectory i of length (t + t) is a random variable having expectation p+. 
Hoeffding's inequality [5] bounds the probability of deviation from the expectation 
p+ by more than e, 
P p p+ >e < exp (-2he 2) def 
- _ _ = v. (8) 
i=1 
Thus if we want the deviation e from the true label probability to be less than 
e < 0.05 with probability at let 1 - V = 0.99 we need approximately n m 1000 
bounces. The computational effort of the above algorithm for a working set of size 
m is of order O (n (m + )).

4 Experimental Results 
We focused on the confidence Xtrans Bayesian Transduction provides together with 
the prediction 1 of the label. If the confidence C'rans reflects reliability of a label 
estimate at a given test point then rejecting those test points whose predictions carry 
low confidence should lead to a reduction in generalisation error on the remaining 
test points. In the experiments we varied a rejection threshold 0 between [0, 1] thus 
obtaining for each 0 a rejeection rate together with an estimate of the generalisation 
error at non-rejected points. Both these curves were linked by their common O-axis 
resulting in a generalisation error versus rejection rate plot. 
We used the UCI 2 data sets ;hyroñd and hear; because they are medical ap- 
plications for which the confidence of single predictions is particularly important. 
Also a high rejection rate due to too conservative a confidence measure may in- 
cur considerable costs. We trained a Support Vector Machine using RBF kernels 
k (x, x ) - exp (-tlx - xll 2/2or 2) with cr chosen such as to insure the existence of a 
version space. We used 100 different training samples obtained by random 60%:40% 
splits of the whole data set. The margin C'nd of each test point was calculated as a 
confidence measure of SVM classifications. For comparison we determined the la- 
bels b and resulting confidences Ctrans using the Bayesian Transduction algorithm 
(see Section 3) with the same value of the kernel parameter. Si.nce the rejection for 
the Bayesian Transduction was in both cases higher than for SVMs at the same level 
0 we determined 0max which achieves the same rejection rate for the SVM confi- 
dence measures as Bayesian Transduction achieves at 0: 1 (l:hyroñd: 0ma x --- 2.15, 
hear1:: 0max = 1.54). The results for the two data sets are depicted in Figure 2. 
In the l:hyroñd example Figure 2 (a) one can see that crans is indeed an appropriate 
indicator of confidence: at a rejection rate of approximately 20% the generalisation 
error approaches zero at minimal variance. For any desired generalisation error 
Bayesian Transduction needs to reject significantly less examples of the test set as 
compared to SVM classifiers, e.g. 4% less at 2.3% generalisation error. The results of 
the hear1: data set show even more pronounced characteristics w.r.t. to the rejection

rate. Note that those confidence measures considered cannot capture the effects of 
noise in the data which leads to a generalisation error of 16.4% even at maximal 
rejection 0 = 1 corresponding to the Bayes error under the given function class. 
5 Conclusions and Future Work 
In this paper we a presented a Bayesian analysis of transduction. The required 
volume estimates for kernel perceptrons in version space are performed by an ergodic 
billiard in kernel space. Most importantly, transduction not only determines the 
label of a given point but also returns a confidence measure of the classification 
in the form of the probability of the label under the model. Using this confidence 
measure to reject test examples then lead to improved generalisation error over 
SVMs. The billiard algorithm can be extended to the case of non-zero training 
error by allowing the ball to penetrate walls, a property that is cap, tured by adding 
a constant A to the diagonal of the kernel matrix [4]. Further research will aim at 
the discovery of PAC-Bayesian bounds on the generalisation error of transduction.
