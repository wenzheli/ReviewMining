Abstract 
The problem of color clustering is defined and shown to be a problem of 
assigning a large number (hundreds of thousands) of 3-vectors to a 
small number (256) of clusters. Finding those clusters in such a way that 
they best represent a full color image using only 256 distinct colors is a 
burdensome computational problem. In this paper, the problem is solved 
using "classical" techniques -- k-means clustering, vector quantization 
(which tums out to be the same thing in this application), competitive 
learning, and Kohonen self-organizing feature maps. Quality of the 
result is judged subjectively by how much the pseudo-color result 
resembles the true color image, by RMS quantization error, and by run 
time. The Kohonen map provides the best solution. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
"Clustering", "vector quantization", and "unsupervised learning" are all words which 
describe the same process: assigning a few exemplars to represent a large set of samples. 
Performing that process is the subject of a substantial body of literature. In this paper, we 
are concerned with the comparison of various clustering techniques to a particular, practi- 
cal application: color clustering. 
The color clustering problem is as follows: an image is recorded in full color -- that is, 
three components, RED, GREEN, and BLUE, each of which has been measured to 8 bits 
of precision. Thus, each pixel is a 24 bit quantity. We must find a representation in which 
2563 possible colors are represented by only 8 bits per pixel. That is, for a problem with 
256000 variables (512 x 512) variables, assign each variable to one of only 256 classes. 
The color clustering problem is currently of major economic interest since millions of dis- 
play systems are sold each year which can only store 8 bits per pixel, but on which users 
would like to be able to display "true" color (or at least as near true color as possible). 
In this study, we have approached the problem using the standard techniques from the lit- 
erature (including k-means -- ISODATA clustering[I,3,6], LBG[4]), competitive learning 
(referred to as CL herein)J2], and Kohonen feature maps[5,7,9]. The Kohonen feature map 
984 
Kohonen Networks and Clustering 985 
(referred to as KFM herein) was found to win "hands down", providing both the best quality image 
(subjectively) and objectively (based on quantization error), as well as the fastest run times. 
2 BACKGROUND - METHODS TESTED 
In almost all clustering algorithms, we begin with some (usually ad-hoc) determination of initial 
cluster centers. The number of such centers generally remains the same, although some algorithms 
(e.g. ISODATA[10]) allow the number to evolve through the running of the algorithm. In this work, 
we know that we want to find 256 distinct clusters. The basic idea behind most of these methods is 
to update the cluster closest to the current data point by moving it some small increment towards 
that data point. Mter the data has been presented to the algorithm sufficiently often, the clusters 
should converge to the real cluster means. Typically, one has to cycle through the training set sew 
eral times (sometimes a large number of times) to get an acceptable solution. Each run though the 
training set is termed an epoch. 
2.1 K-MEANS 
The well-known [6] k-means algorithm for clustering is as follows (see [10] for a tutorial explana- 
tion). 
1. gegin with an arbitrary assignment of samples to clusters or begin with an arbitrary set of clus- 
ter centers and assign samples to nearest centers. 
2. Compute the sample mean of each cluster. 
3. Reassign each sample to the cluster with the nearest mean. 
4. If the classification of all samples has not changed, stop; else go to step 2. 
2.2 LBG VECTOR QUANTIZATION 
In this method, 256 colors are picked randomly from the scene. These are referred to as the "code- 
book". Each pixel in the image is then assign .e;d to the "nearest" entry in the codebook. After 
assignment of all pixels, the mean of each bin I is calculated. If the difference between the code- 
book entry and the mean of the corresponding bin is below threshold for all entries, the "optimal" 
codebook has been located. In [4], the algorithm is shown to work for a large variety of distance 
functions; however, for applications (such as this one) where the Euclidean metric is most appropri- 
ate, the algorithm becomes identical to k-means. In [8], results similar to those we found are 
reported in the color clustering problem. 
2.3 KOHONEN MAPS AND COMPETITIVE LEARNING 
In competitive learning algorithms, data examples are presented sequentially to the system. The 
cluster center most similar to the data example is determined, and that center is moved slightly 
toward the example. 
1 That is, all the pixels assigned to that entry in the codebook. 
986 Snyder, Nissman, Van den Bout, and Bilbro 
The update rule for competitive learning can be described as follows: 
new _ old+ _ old. 
co i % n (data - 
= CO i ) 
(EQ 1) 
where wi is the weight vector (or mean) corresponding to cluster i and h is the learning parameter 
(typically on the order of 0.01). 
In the case of Kohonen maps, however, the algorithm is slightly more complicated. All clusters are 
connected to each other according to a topological map. When the closest cluster to a data point 
(the primary cluster) is updated, so are its immediate neighbors (the proximity clusters) in terms of 
the topological map. In feature space, it is possible, initially, for the neighbors of the primary clus- 
ter to not be its topological neighbors. By the nature of the update rule, the neighbors of the primary 
cluster in topological space will become its neighbors in feature space after some period of time. 
This is very desirable for applications in which a minimum distance between related clusters is 
desired (the Traveling Salesman Problem, for example). 
Often, it is the case that a single cluster is chosen much of the time, if not all of the time, because of 
the order in which data is presented and the manner in which the clusters are initialized. In order to 
make clustering work in a practical context, one needs to include a term in the distance calculation 
which reduces the probability of updating an often-used cluster. Such a term is called the con- 
science[2]. Its effect is to increase the effective distance of a cluster from a data point An altema- 
live approach to the use of a conscience is to increment a counter for each cluster which has been 
passed over for updating and then subtract some multiple of this counter from the calculated dis- 
tance. We call this the loneliness term, and used it because the implementation turned out to be 
more convenient, and the performance similar to that of conscience. 
For KFM, the primary cluster is updated as indicated in Eqn. 1. The proximity clusters are updated 
in a similar fashion 
oa? w = co td + F ( q, do) (data- co td) 
(EQ2) 
where wj is the weight vector corresponding to the proximity cluster j, d o is the topological distance 
between'clusters i and j, and F (q, do) is some decreasing function of the distance between i andj 
with a maximum at q. 
3 Application to Color Clustering 
Making no assumptions concerning the input image, we chose an appropriate topology for the 
KFM algorithm which would easily lend itself to describing a uniform distribution of colors in 
RGB space. Such a distribution is a rectangular solid in the 3-D color space. We chose the dimen- 
sions of this block to be 6x7x6 -- corresponding to 252 clusters rather than the 256 allowable -- 
under the assumption that the omission of those four clusters would not make a perceptible differ- 
ence. The clusters were initialized as a small block positioned at the center of RGB space with the 
long axis in the green direction. This orientation was chosen because human eyes are most sensitive 
to green wavelengths and, hence, more resolution may be required along this axis. The exact initial 
orientation does not matter in the final solution, but was chosen to aid in speed of convergence. 
Kohonen Networks and Clustering 987 
In an attempt to significantly speed up training, each data point was assigned to one of the eight 
subcubes of RGB space, and then only a specified subset of clusters was searched for an appropri- 
ate candidate for updating. The clusters were subdivided, roughly, into eight subcubes as well. The 
effect of this is to decrease training time by approximately a factor of eight. Also, in the interest of 
processing time, only the six most immediate topological neighbors (those with a topological dis- 
tance of one from the primary cluster) were ulxlated. This same heuristic was applied for both CL 
and KFM experiments. 
4 RESULTS 
We applied all the techniques discussed, in various implementations, to actual color images, includ- 
ing'in particular, pictures of faces. Although also tested on larger images, all times given in this 
report are against a baseline case of a 128x128 image: three bands of input (red, green, blue -- 8 bits 
each), and one band (8 bits) of output, plus a lookup table output indicating what 24 bit color each 
of the 8 bit pattern represented. Given sufficient training, all the techniques produced pseudo-color 
images which were extremely lifelike. Comparing the images closely on a CRT, a trained observer 
will note variations in the color rendering, particularly in sparse colors (e.g. blue eyes in a facial 
scene), and will also observe color contouring. However, these details are subtle, and are not easily 
reproducible in a conference proceedings. Map files and corresponding images were generated for 
5, 10, and 15 epochs using h = 0.05 and proximity h = 0.00625. Direct comparisons were made 
between Kohonen feature maps, competitive learning, and the results from k-means (and the LBG 
formulation of k-means). For the training runs using competitive learning, all clusters were initial- 
ized to random values within the unit sphere located in the center of RGB space. The conscience 
concept was used here. 
In this section all timing comparisons are done on a Microvax 2000, although we have also nan 
many of the same programs on a Decstation. The Decstation typically runs 10-15 times as fast as 
the Microvax. In order to compare techniques fairly, all timing is reported for the same image. 
4.1 K-MEANS AND LBG EXPERIMENTS 
The performance of k-means and LBG algorithms were strongly dependent on how long they were 
allowed to run. After approximately 90 minutes of execution of k-means, the results were as good 
(subjectively) as from Kohonen maps. In different experiments, k-means was started from the fol- 
lowing initial configurations: 
1.256 points randomly (uniformly) distributed over RGB space 
2. The 256 points on the main diagonal of color space (red=green=blue) 
3. A uniform (3D) grid spread over RGB 
4. Uniformly distributed over the surface of the color cube 
5. Randomly distributed near the origin

Choice 2 gave the best overall performance, where "best" is determined by the time required to 
converge to a point where the resulfng image looked "equally good" subjectively. K-means 
reqøuired 87 minutes to reach this standard quality, although it took 9 hours to completely converge 
(until no cluster centex moved more than .5 units in one iteration). 
4.2 EXPERIMENTS ON KOHONEN AND COMPETITIVE LEARNING 
KFM gave an excellent rendering of color images. In particular, blue eyes were rendered extremely 
well in images of faces. Depending on the value of the conscience parameter, the competitive learn- 
ing algorithm tended to rendered blue eyes as brown, since the dominant skin tones in facial images 
are shades of brown. 
Speed comparisons. All of these runs were done on Microvaxen.

The subjective judgments of piculre quality were made using the 10 epoch case of Kohonen maps 
as a reference. To quantitatively compare the performance of Kohonen maps and competitive learn- 
ing, we computed the RMS color error: 
E -- E 
(EQ 3) 
where v i is the actual color 3-vector at pixel i, and c i is the color represented by the mean of the 
cluster to which pixel i is currently assigned. Plotting E vs. epoch number for both Kohonen and 
competitive learning, we find the results in the figure below.

Epochs 
It is clear from this figure that the KFM network converges more rapidly to a stable solution with 
much lower error than does the competitive network. Such figures can be deceiving in image pro- 
cessing, however, since RMS error is a notoriously bad quality measure (small regions may have 
very large errors in order to make the overall average error low). In this case, however, the 
Kohonen map preserves the accuracy of color rendering in small regions quite well. 
To 9valuate the sensitivity to initial cluster center choices, both competitive learning and KFM 
were applied with different choices of centers. We found that competitive learning often converged 
to undesirable renderings, whereas KFM always yielded a good solution, even when the initial cen- 
ters were all at 0,0,0. 
5 DISCUSSION 
The quality of rendering attained by these algorithms is due to the nature of facial images. There is 
a great deal of density in the flesh colored region and a comparatively smaller, but nonetheless siz- 
990 Snyder, Nissman, Van den Bout, and Bilbro 
able, amount in the background colors. The competitive learning algorithm found these high den- 
siF regions with no problem. Greater difficulty was had with the blue eyes, since there are few 
examples of blue to be trained on and hence the algorithm was swamped by the high density 
regions. If one let the competitive learning algorithm run for a large number of epochs, it eventually 
found the blue cluster. The assignment of clusters to subdivisions of feature space guarantees that 
no region of the image was particularly emphasized, therefore allowing clusters that were solely 
influenced by less represented colors. However, this can also "waste" clusters in regions where 
there are few exampJes. 
Furthermore, the topological structure of the Kohonen map allows one to make certain assumptions 
to speed up the algorithm. 
Despite a minor penalty in computational speed per epoch, the Kohonen algorithm produces the 
image with the least error in the least amount of time. With appropriate choice of parameters, the 
clustered image becomes indistinguishable from the original in less than ten epochs, for essentially 
arbitrary initial conditions (as opposed to competitive learning). The other clustering techniques 
require signilicanfly longer times.
